fcqastm,t3_eigzia,t3_eigzia,"It's not that the everyday urban common man doesn't know about the Kashmir issue and all the alleged atrocities committed by the Indian Army but it's the Indian media narrative, since a long time, justifying each and every atrocity is what keeps our countrymen from thinking of it as anything else other than the armed forces keeping an insurgency at check. 

There's a reason why the RW ecosystem and now Modi himself calls every educated and sane critical thinking citizen of this country an anti national/ urban naxal and the likes. They know that if the young population of this country actually starts listening and understanding any of the contentious issues this country faces there will be localized uprising in every state and the govt in power can not let that happen. Instead, delegitimizing the messenger is a better way to blunt the message itself. Kashmir is an issue which is not going to be solved in a long long time no matter which side of the political spectrum you stand on. Abrogation of 370 is not going to do much to keep the local population down which is already broken. There are a million articles online by reputed journalists stating how the Kashmiri population has sever mental issues because of the continued state of oppression and general feeling of repression. The ones who left the state thrived and are the voices speaking out but the local population is more or less beaten into depression. Which is what the state hoped for when they employed the multitudes of operations you have stated. 

Every country has their skeletons and we are no different. Kashmir is a corpse which refuses to turn into a skeleton. The body stinks and the world turns a blind eye. Take what you may out of it.",notanothervoice,,t2_5056b1vm,/r/india/comments/eigzia/do_we_owe_an_apology_to_kashmir/fcqastm/,1577882331,1,0

He first went to the ships, saw the dreadful condition of the kids, spoke to the captains and went to meet the governor. ‚ÄúOur father tried to convince him, but when he failed, he was so frustrated, he went back to the ships and asked them to move to Nawanagar‚Äôs Rosi port. He took them all off and put them in tented accommodation for a few months before the Balachadi camp came up,‚Äù the siblings recall.

Another extraordinary detail recounted by the siblings is that when the viceregal office in Delhi objected to him taking in foreigners, he said they were part of his family, and even produced an adoption certificate. ‚ÄúOur father politically adopted them,‚Äù says Harshad Kumari, adding that he bankrolled the project from his personal funds.

CAA/NRC will only be a determining factor for a minority proportion of Delhi's voter base. Multiple surveys have proven that air quality, healthcare and education will be the actual determining features of this year's elections.

I watched a YouTube video series posted by ""Where the Jones"" in Pakistan and was pleasantly surprised how civilised and morally upright people they can be. The whole series has been a big eye opener. I also saw the Indian series by the same vlogger and could see the stark difference we have vis a vis Pakistan.

fcqexh3,t1_fcqdmpc,t3_eigs8n,"Thanks for the clarification. I have to say I still retain my stance that CAA makes sense with one exception which I will end with. Ask any secular liberal person in Afghanisan and Pakistan and they will say that hindus, and other minority groups do face persecution or prejudice. Hindu girls are kidnapped at exceedingly high rates in Pakistan. Sikhs face discrimination in Afghanistan. Just because it is a secular country does not mean you cannot give refugee status based on religion if that is the indicator of discrimination, which does exist. 

Using Sri Lanka as an example, a majority of the Refugees to countries like USA and Canada were tamil hindus and muslims. Very few Sinhalese and buddists were given refugee status to those countries, if they were it was on a case by case basis(Ex one of Edward Snowden's guardian angel was a sinhalese buddhist given asylum in Canada). 

If Bangladesh where the Rohingya has their roots and is the actual bordering nation to Burma are not willing to take them why should India?

Lastly, the contention and principle I agree with you on is Sri Lanka. Muslims in Sri Lanka are a persecuted minority with some having Indian origin so I do believe to be fair they should also be benificiaries of CAA.",chickenbis,,t2_5amgwwmc,/r/india/comments/eigs8n/modi_bjp_are_creating_a_climate_of_fear_in_india/fcqexh3/,1577884660,1,0

Extremism, both 1. Leftwing and 2. Rightwing
The political elite, which has transformed India‚Äôs political parties into family organizations. Because of this,

3. Public institutions¬†such as universities, the police and the judiciary have deteriorated and¬†

4. Democratic openness¬†is victim to corruption.

5. The increasing gap between rich and poor.¬†Witness Mukesh Ambani's 27-floor house for his five-member family in Mumbai

6. Disastrous damage to the environment.¬†Lack of regulation or corporate responsibility means water supplies are at risk, people are breathing poisonous air. Irretrievable damage to health and resources continues and no one is accountable.

7. The apathy of the media.¬†The media has essentially been co-opted by the government and corporations. Many journalists even re-trained as financial analysts in the 19990s.

8. No long-term policy. The political chaos that accompanies a pluralist system makes it difficult to form stable long-term policy.

Territorial instability in 9. The northeast and 10. The northwest¬†of the country. Three of India‚Äôs 28 states are struggling for independence.

In the words of Guha: ""There are too many fault lines in our society to be a superpower.

fcqreuz,t1_fcqhzar,t3_eigzia,"1)  J&amp;K was given a special status that gave it the power of autonomy (the only state in whole of India). How are people from other states, who were not able to buy even an inch of land there, can be held responsible for all the much alleged atrocities (specially in the valley)?

2) J&amp;K receives 10% of Central funds despite having only about 1% of total population. Rougly estimates to INR 91,300 per person. If the kashmiris feel they are under neglect and poverty they should blame the leaders they elect (IF they go and vote, which seems to be dubious looking at the voters' turnover everytime). No wonder how much money the kashmiri leaders shove up their ass under the the guise, while the general kashmiris. It is their leaders, that they elect, who have failed them. The 'outsiders' which are the actual tax payers have taken nothing from Kashmir.

3) Most of the population of india is Hindu. The mass exodus of kashmiri hindus and sikhs from the state which unabashedly included mosques screeching the decimation of minority. If you love an islamic country, go ahead pack your bags and leave. Just because the area has a muslim majority does not mean that it belongs to a religion. The damn capital is named Srinagar and the last ruler was rajput, does that mean it every hindu should claim it as a ""hindu only"" land? Should every hindu start kicking muslims out from there?how are the mainlanders, maximum of which are hindus and still consider the state and the people as its own owe a damn apology?

4)The presence of high insurgency is not because India wants to ""capture"" Kashmir. Its because the kashmiris are still blindfolded, still believe in supremacy and islamic state breeding terrorists. The stone that they throw at the army are not revolutionary weapons of independence. 

 The ONLY problem creator is the refusal of ONE religion to peacefully co-exist with the other. How hard is it to shut your eyes and clench your fist if you see someone or something that your religion forbids? 

How the mainlanders are in debts of kashmir? What have they taken from kashmir? What resources have been exploited by the mainlanders? How has the average kashmiri been discriminated against by the mainlanders? What should we call sorry for?

The audience's tastes have sure changed and they can no longer be satisfied by mediocre performances and half baked scripts. Come on man, just look at their choice of films these past 5 years.

1. Thugs of hindustan - seriously? Aamir khan channels his inner Johhny depp in this low grade caricature of Pirates of Caribbean.
2. Zero: Vertically challenged Shahrukh gets katrina and Anushka and some Nasa shit
3. Fan : I wouldn't even comment on that
4. Harry met sejal: why?
5. Dabangg 3: That horse was dead long ago, the second part was itself unnecessary, the 3rd is a travesty
6. Tubelight : Only tubelights can suffer through that
7. Bharat: God that movie was a torture but still made 300 crores

The last decent movies they acted in was pk, Bajrangi Bhaijaan and Chhak de India. After that you can see their choice of films above.

On the other hand we had movies with slick editing and novel scripts like Andhadhun, Gullyboy, Padmavat, Uri, Badhai ho etc from the new crop of actors.

fcqwt0s,t1_fcquepi,t3_eigs8n,"CAA makes sense with one exception which I will end with. Ask any secular liberal person in Afghanisan and Pakistan and they will say that hindus, and other minority groups do face persecution or prejudice. Hindu girls are kidnapped at exceedingly high rates in Pakistan. Sikhs face discrimination in Afghanistan. Just because it is a secular country does not mean you cannot give refugee status based on religion if that is the indicator of discrimination, which does exist.

Using Sri Lanka as an example, a majority of the Refugees to secular countries like USA and Canada were tamil hindus and muslims. Very few Sinhalese and buddists were given refugee status to those countries, if they were it was on a case by case basis(Ex one of Edward Snowden's guardian angel was a sinhalese buddhist given asylum in Canada).

If Bangladesh where the Rohingya has their roots and is the actual bordering nation to Burma are not willing to take them why should India?

Lastly, the contention and principle I agree with you on is Sri Lanka. Tamil Muslims in Sri Lanka are a persecuted minority having Indian origin so I do believe to be fair they should also be benificiaries of CAA.

Pathway to citizenship for refugee/asylum to any group has to be selective in nature and for most of the history of western democracy and democracies influenced by western civilization. The selection criteria should be on a region to by region basis with a selective criteria that is tailored for each region.

THe only point from that uncredible source lol 'urbannazi' i took is the Sri Lankan Muslim issue, who i am sympathetic too. Sri Lankan Tamil Muslims should be covered by CAA. (try a credible source not some blog)

As for the passport quote I have to double check if it is accurate but if he did say that it is ridiculous. 

I am for the most part pro CAA and I dont see why giving citizenship to 32,000 who have been in India for over 5 years from minorities in their prior countries is worth all the protest. Yes Sri Lankan Muslims should be included but all I see is people protesting to just strip the law in its entire form or add all muslims from neighboring countries even muslim majority countries. 

There are historical precedents for paving a pathway to citizenship for people based on religion in other countries. Post WWII and during the onset of the cold war, for the most part the only immigrants from the former USSR who were given this pathway were Jewish. There were some exceptions of course.",chickenbis,,t2_5amgwwmc,/r/india/comments/eigs8n/modi_bjp_are_creating_a_climate_of_fear_in_india/fcqwt0s/,1577893411,1,0

However, Religion should not be blanket criteria to give citizenship, which is the case with CAA. The new set up defaults a ""legal"" status on everyone from these select communities, while closing its doors on others (atheist and Muslims and other tribal sects) which will still be considered as ""illegal"" and hence will not have a route to citizenship at all. That's quite discriminatory by any measure.

One can continue to support CAA, but then the person must accept that they value people based on their religion in which case for them such discrimination is valid. If you don't value people based on their religion (which is little more than an accident for most of us), then it's not hard to see why CAA is plain immoral.",gujjuben,,t2_17c6a6,/r/india/comments/eigs8n/modi_bjp_are_creating_a_climate_of_fear_in_india/fcqznwf/,1577894605,1,0
