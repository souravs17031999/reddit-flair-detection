fcqastm,t3_eigzia,t3_eigzia,"It's not that the everyday urban common man doesn't know about the Kashmir issue and all the alleged atrocities committed by the Indian Army but it's the Indian media narrative, since a long time, justifying each and every atrocity is what keeps our countrymen from thinking of it as anything else other than the armed forces keeping an insurgency at check. 

There's a reason why the RW ecosystem and now Modi himself calls every educated and sane critical thinking citizen of this country an anti national/ urban naxal and the likes. They know that if the young population of this country actually starts listening and understanding any of the contentious issues this country faces there will be localized uprising in every state and the govt in power can not let that happen. Instead, delegitimizing the messenger is a better way to blunt the message itself. Kashmir is an issue which is not going to be solved in a long long time no matter which side of the political spectrum you stand on. Abrogation of 370 is not going to do much to keep the local population down which is already broken. There are a million articles online by reputed journalists stating how the Kashmiri population has sever mental issues because of the continued state of oppression and general feeling of repression. The ones who left the state thrived and are the voices speaking out but the local population is more or less beaten into depression. Which is what the state hoped for when they employed the multitudes of operations you have stated.

Kinda makes sense why the poles didn't settle in the ""Anglo sphere"" Canada, Ireland, Gibraltar, Australia, New Zealand or the other British colonies.

Hiding from the invaders, they were rescued and put on small ships that travelled from port to port—in Scotland, Ireland, Africa—but were barred from entering. Finally, they arrived in Bombay, where the British governor also refused entry (saying he did not have permission from the home office in London, and that they came from enemy territory). Enter the Jam Saheb, then an Indian representative on the imperial war cabinet in London chaired by Winston Churchill. Hearing of the children’s plight from the Polish prime minister-in-exile, he flew immediately to Bombay. He first went to the ships, saw the dreadful condition of the kids, spoke to the captains and went to meet the governor. “Our father tried to convince him, but when he failed, he was so frustrated, he went back to the ships and asked them to move to Nawanagar’s Rosi port. He took them all off and put them in tented accommodation for a few months before the Balachadi camp came up,” the siblings recall.

Another extraordinary detail recounted by the siblings is that when the viceregal office in Delhi objected to him taking in foreigners, he said they were part of his family, and even produced an adoption certificate. “Our father politically adopted them,” says Harshad Kumari, adding that he bankrolled the project from his personal funds.

fcqexh3,t1_fcqdmpc,t3_eigs8n,"Thanks for the clarification. I have to say I still retain my stance that CAA makes sense with one exception which I will end with. Ask any secular liberal person in Afghanisan and Pakistan and they will say that hindus, and other minority groups do face persecution or prejudice. Hindu girls are kidnapped at exceedingly high rates in Pakistan. Sikhs face discrimination in Afghanistan. Just because it is a secular country does not mean you cannot give refugee status based on religion if that is the indicator of discrimination, which does exist. 

Using Sri Lanka as an example, a majority of the Refugees to countries like USA and Canada were tamil hindus and muslims. Very few Sinhalese and buddists were given refugee status to those countries, if they were it was on a case by case basis(Ex one of Edward Snowden's guardian angel was a sinhalese buddhist given asylum in Canada). 

If Bangladesh where the Rohingya has their roots and is the actual bordering nation to Burma are not willing to take them why should India?

Lastly, the contention and principle I agree with you on is Sri Lanka.

Extremism, both 1. Leftwing and 2. Rightwing
The political elite, which has transformed India’s political parties into family organizations. Because of this,

3. Public institutions such as universities, the police and the judiciary have deteriorated and 

4. Democratic openness is victim to corruption.

5. The increasing gap between rich and poor. Witness Mukesh Ambani's 27-floor house for his five-member family in Mumbai

6. Disastrous damage to the environment. Lack of regulation or corporate responsibility means water supplies are at risk, people are breathing poisonous air. Irretrievable damage to health and resources continues and no one is accountable.

7. The apathy of the media. The media has essentially been co-opted by the government and corporations. Many journalists even re-trained as financial analysts in the 19990s.

8. No long-term policy. The political chaos that accompanies a pluralist system makes it difficult to form stable long-term policy.

Territorial instability in 9. The northeast and 10. The northwest of the country. Three of India’s 28 states are struggling for independence.

fcqreuz,t1_fcqhzar,t3_eigzia,"1)  J&amp;K was given a special status that gave it the power of autonomy (the only state in whole of India). How are people from other states, who were not able to buy even an inch of land there, can be held responsible for all the much alleged atrocities (specially in the valley)?

2) J&amp;K receives 10% of Central funds despite having only about 1% of total population. Rougly estimates to INR 91,300 per person. If the kashmiris feel they are under neglect and poverty they should blame the leaders they elect (IF they go and vote, which seems to be dubious looking at the voters' turnover everytime). No wonder how much money the kashmiri leaders shove up their ass under the the guise, while the general kashmiris. It is their leaders, that they elect, who have failed them. The 'outsiders' which are the actual tax payers have taken nothing from Kashmir.

3) Most of the population of india is Hindu. The mass exodus of kashmiri hindus and sikhs from the state which unabashedly included mosques screeching the decimation of minority. If you love an islamic country, go ahead pack your bags and leave. Just because the area has a muslim majority does not mean that it belongs to a religion. The damn capital is named Srinagar and the last ruler was rajput, does that mean it every hindu should claim it as a ""hindu only"" land? Should every hindu start kicking muslims out from there?how are the mainlanders, maximum of which are hindus and still consider the state and the people as its own owe a damn apology?

4)The presence of high insurgency is not because India wants to ""capture"" Kashmir. Its because the kashmiris are still blindfolded, still believe in supremacy and islamic state breeding terrorists. The stone that they throw at the army are not revolutionary weapons of independence. 

 The ONLY problem creator is the refusal of ONE religion to peacefully co-exist with the other. How hard is it to shut your eyes and clench your fist if you see someone or something that your religion forbids? 

How the mainlanders are in debts of kashmir? What have they taken from kashmir? What resources have been exploited by the mainlanders? How has the average kashmiri been discriminated against by the mainlanders? What should we call sorry for?

fcqwt0s,t1_fcquepi,t3_eigs8n,"CAA makes sense with one exception which I will end with. Ask any secular liberal person in Afghanisan and Pakistan and they will say that hindus, and other minority groups do face persecution or prejudice. Hindu girls are kidnapped at exceedingly high rates in Pakistan. Sikhs face discrimination in Afghanistan. Just because it is a secular country does not mean you cannot give refugee status based on religion if that is the indicator of discrimination, which does exist.

Using Sri Lanka as an example, a majority of the Refugees to secular countries like USA and Canada were tamil hindus and muslims. Very few Sinhalese and buddists were given refugee status to those countries, if they were it was on a case by case basis(Ex one of Edward Snowden's guardian angel was a sinhalese buddhist given asylum in Canada).

If Bangladesh where the Rohingya has their roots and is the actual bordering nation to Burma are not willing to take them why should India?

Lastly, the contention and principle I agree with you on is Sri Lanka. Tamil Muslims in Sri Lanka are a persecuted minority having Indian origin so I do believe to be fair they should also be benificiaries of CAA.

Pathway to citizenship for refugee/asylum to any group has to be selective in nature and for most of the history of western democracy and democracies influenced by western civilization. The selection criteria should be on a region to by region basis with a selective criteria that is tailored for each region.

THe only point from that uncredible source lol 'urbannazi' i took is the Sri Lankan Muslim issue, who i am sympathetic too. Sri Lankan Tamil Muslims should be covered by CAA. (try a credible source not some blog)

As for the passport quote I have to double check if it is accurate but if he did say that it is ridiculous. 

I am for the most part pro CAA and I dont see why giving citizenship to 32,000 who have been in India for over 5 years from minorities in their prior countries is worth all the protest. Yes Sri Lankan Muslims should be included but all I see is people protesting to just strip the law in its entire form or add all muslims from neighboring countries even muslim majority countries. 

There are historical precedents for paving a pathway to citizenship for people based on religion in other countries. Post WWII and during the onset of the cold war, for the most part the only immigrants from the former USSR who were given this pathway were Jewish.

Also she’s writing for a foreign audience so there’s a limited amount of space for nuance.

No way, Buddhism &amp; Jainism reject the vedas, prescribe different ethics, have different theologies &amp; teleologies, and had a history of competition. They arose very much in opposition to Hinduism.

Even deities, rituals, prayers specially rejected the old brahminical order, and envision an entirely different social order.

The history of our country's independence is that our revolutionaries were so fed up of authoritarianism, they started assassinating government officials. 

What is going on in this country is unfair to our people. Our economic policies have been designed to keep us poor. It is simply not possible to compete with the outside world with so many economic restrictions. The outside world already is at least 20 years ahead. 

By the time we legalized computers, Steve Jobs had already founded Apple and Gates, Microsoft. Skype was founded and possibly sold, why BSNL still continued to lobby to keep Video calling illegal.

China, US etc are not going to create jobs or opportunities for us, or for our future generations. 

If each of us don't individually act, we will have total anarchy and chaos, or worse -  we will be destined to live as slaves. 

Economic and social growth comes from rights. Our economic and individual rights are simply not at par with the rest of the world. Without parity in rights, there can never be equality. 

Our country was founded upon this principle of equality - that a person from India/Bharat should have the same rights as their western peer. This is why our constitution has such strong protection for minority rights.

fg6da9r,t3_ex5y54,t3_ex5y54,"Nothing new here. PM Modi is transferring wealth from the middle class to the poor, because the middle class will anyway vote BJP for nationalism &amp; dislike of Muslims.

&gt; [Modi] has taken from those in the middle to give to those at the bottom, and both are voting for him with equal enthusiasm. The middle classes have emerged as his most rock-solid vote bank. And they happily pay for it.

&gt; the Modi government has carried out probably the most spectacular and efficient transfer, or redistribution, of national wealth to the poor. It is tough to estimate it to the last decimal point, but between housing, toilets, cooking gas and Mudra loans, anything between Rs 9-11 lakh crore was distributed to the poor. 

&gt; this bought enough votes from the grateful poor for Modi to sweep the election.

&gt; the real joke is on the middle classes. Because, as in 2014-19, they’re the ones who will contribute the wealth to be transferred to the poor. To begin with, the finance minister gifted them additional taxes on petrol and diesel in the budget to ‘make up’, hold your breath, for the drop in crude prices.

&gt; This has followed a string of policies that can only be described as “soak the middle class” and not the rich. During the Modi years, Long Term Capital Gains tax (LTCG) on equities was introduced, dividend distribution tax (DDT) was increased, additional tax was levied on dividend income above Rs 10 lakh per year, surcharge on incomes between Rs 50 lakh and one crore was raised (unless you call them super-rich today), import duty on gold increased to 12.5 per cent from 10 per cent, and subsidies were reduced and taken away from the middle class, including on cooking gas.

&gt; That Modi and the BJP can continue to treat the rising and expanding middle class this way shows that they have gamed its mind perfectly. Its loyalty to them is fired not so much by economic impulse as by something more visceral: The resurgent, muscular Hindu definition of Indian nationalism that they have bought into. Add to this the dislike of the Muslim. Many of them may still find lynchings abhorrent, but they are quite happy to see Muslims completely out of the power structure: Cabinet, top government positions, and greatly reduced in Parliament.

&gt; completely forgot the promises Goyal had made to the middle class in his speech in February: Increase in standard deduction, TDS threshold, relaxation of tax slabs. Why should we bother when you will vote for us out of your love for us, while the poor vote with gratitude?

Insurance isn't a public good and it's not 60s where private sector didn't have enough funds. No one is telling govt to exit the public goods sector like health, education etc. Just for your information, LIC charges a higher premium than private company in virtually every category of health insurance. So it's not exactly doing charity as you are making it sound. And it uses that fund to precisely bail out failing and misgoverned company. 

In short, LIC is not taking losses for the betterment of its consumers. It's taking losses* for the betterment of misgoverned companies. How on earth do you even bail out a bank which has 30% toxic loans (IDBI).

*When I said taking losses, I don't mean absolute net loss. LIC is profitable. I mean losses in forms of bad investments.

&gt;No because consumers know that they govt won't fail like a private corporation even if they invest in other failing govt assets... This is done all the time really


Yes it's done and it's misutilization of public funds which I wrote in the next part of the sentence which you deliberately truncated. Govt assets fail because of misgovernance.

fg6dxux,t3_ex6d6l,t3_ex6d6l,"Now that the 2020 budget had been presented, I just wanted to repost an old but very relevant article. PM Modi is transferring wealth from the middle class to the poor, because the middle class will anyway vote BJP for nationalism &amp; dislike of Muslims.

&gt; [Modi] has taken from those in the middle to give to those at the bottom, and both are voting for him with equal enthusiasm. The middle classes have emerged as his most rock-solid vote bank. And they happily pay for it.

&gt; the Modi government has carried out probably the most spectacular and efficient transfer, or redistribution, of national wealth to the poor. It is tough to estimate it to the last decimal point, but between housing, toilets, cooking gas and Mudra loans, anything between Rs 9-11 lakh crore was distributed to the poor. 

&gt; this bought enough votes from the grateful poor for Modi to sweep the election.

&gt; the real joke is on the middle classes. Because, as in 2014-19, they’re the ones who will contribute the wealth to be transferred to the poor. To begin with, the finance minister gifted them additional taxes on petrol and diesel in the budget to ‘make up’, hold your breath, for the drop in crude prices.

&gt; This has followed a string of policies that can only be described as “soak the middle class” and not the rich. During the Modi years, Long Term Capital Gains tax (LTCG) on equities was introduced, dividend distribution tax (DDT) was increased, additional tax was levied on dividend income above Rs 10 lakh per year, surcharge on incomes between Rs 50 lakh and one crore was raised (unless you call them super-rich today), import duty on gold increased to 12.5 per cent from 10 per cent, and subsidies were reduced and taken away from the middle class, including on cooking gas.

&gt; That Modi and the BJP can continue to treat the rising and expanding middle class this way shows that they have gamed its mind perfectly. Its loyalty to them is fired not so much by economic impulse as by something more visceral: The resurgent, muscular Hindu definition of Indian nationalism that they have bought into. Add to this the dislike of the Muslim. Many of them may still find lynchings abhorrent, but they are quite happy to see Muslims completely out of the power structure: Cabinet, top government positions, and greatly reduced in Parliament.

&gt; completely forgot the promises Goyal had made to the middle class in his speech in February: Increase in standard deduction, TDS threshold, relaxation of tax slabs. Why should we bother when you will vote for us out of your love for us, while the poor vote with gratitude?

Excerpt from Wikipedia article:
&gt;Since the early 1950s, India has debated whether legal pluralism should be replaced with legal universalism and a uniform civil code that does not differentiate between people based on their religion. This debate remains unresolved. The Quran-based Indian Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act of 1937 remains the law of land of modern India for Indian Muslims, while parliament-based, non-religious uniform civil code passed in mid-1950s applies to Indians who are Hindus (which includes Buddhists, Jains, Sikhs, Parsees), as well as to Indian Christians and Jews.[72] In 1955, India revised its Hindu Marriage Act and it applied to all Hindus, Buddhists, Jains and Sikhs; scholars contest whether the law applies to cases where the either the husband or wife is Hindu, Buddhist, Jain or Sikh, and the other is a Christian or Muslim.[69]

Hinduism ( as brahminism ) predates Shankaracharya by almost 1500yrs, so you cannot conflate reforms done later to former period. 

Now, Source is Vedas themselves. You can check out ""the history of ancient and medieval India"" by upinder Singh. Read about vedic society chapters.  A really nuanced book about Indian history. Doesn't carry much ideological baggage as many other books. 

Vedas clearly mention the role of purohitas (brahmins ) and Rajan ( Kshatriyas) as heaven and earth with purohitas given the masculine role among the duo, indicating the upper hand during vedic societies. 

Deriving lineage from gods is a norm all over the world. After all, before the evolution of concept of modern nation state, king had to justify his rule often with the help of priests. 

 I'm sure you know about Pharaohs of Egypt. They are considered as living representatives of gods. 
Alexander did it with Zeus and Hercules. Thai and Burmese kings did it with Buddha with Thai kinds even till this day depended on brahmin priests for ceremonies. Ancient Indian kings especially magadha, who dominated most of North India derived their lineage from sun or moon clans. 

One interesting thing is the commie party of China who are officially atheists, continue to believe in the concept of ""mandate of heaven"" which was used by ancient Chinese emperors to justify their rules. This is why they go to lengths hiding calamities like SARS, coronavirus earth quakes as they can be inferred as them losing the mandate. 

Ofcourse, note that Kshatriyas and Brahmins were often in a zero sum game too. With Kshatriyas being the top in certain brahmanas and Brahmins being at top in other instances, clearly shows there was a rivalry between them. In one brahmana, vaishyas were the no. 2 in caste order than brahmins ! It indicates that caste order was not set in stone till the rise of Gupta dynasty and manu smiriti. 

Infact, Jainism and Buddhism were patronised by ancient kings to decrease brahmin influence and rise of brahmins. From these you can infer how brahmins and kings were related in governance. Way too common in ancient India and world.",codenamebk201,,t2_efdmz,/r/india/comments/ewz5ue/ashoka_the_great_rise_of_the_mauryan_empire/fg6hoes/,1580568253,1,0

They are in (to put it frivolously) ""Tum kare to chamatkar aur hum kare to balatkaar"" type of situation and it took me a while to realize that. The stereotypes are so strongly etched in everyone's mind that it is difficult to counter it. If you read in newspaper some news report that mentions a hindu family having 4 children, you only focus on the story but if it was a Muslim family then immediately your eye brows raise ""yeh saare muslims hum do hamare 25 karne pe toole hain"". Just mins back I had a call with my mom (who isn't a Modi-supporter thankfully). We were discussing about some video that she received about how muslims are going to be more in numbers soon and all that shit...after explaining how all that is fake propaganda..i asked her...when she sees a muslim man in a cap what does she feel? She was quick to say, it angers her everytime she sees men in cap and women in burqa. I told her hating burqa is fine but why hate the cap? We don't hate sikhs because they wear turbans. Hell, we don't hate them even when they carry a weapon. Muslims have been protesting for more than a month..and none so far has gone and done anything radical but we have two hindus who have.

You can register as composite dealer and file simple return but no industry will buy from you because the the tax given to you cannot be claimed. 
So, you will be sidelined in favor of big industry players.

If you opt for normal dealer, you have to be VERY careful in submitting returns regularly or else it will never match with your supplier and customer's returns. 

Now multiply it with infrequent power and frequent GST website malfunction and you will almost, just almost give up doing it on your own. 

If that happens, you are almost 5k up every month for outsourcing the returns filing.
 
I know the pain. 

I do it for three of my companies every month and the pain of filing returns cannot be described by writing but I assure you that if you sit with me while I do it, you'll either throw up or bang your fist on monitor in frustration.

I waste five days worth of productivity in a month on average for GST filing. 
So, you see the amount of loss cannot be specified literally.

Also, GST has been implemented on top of other taxes. 
Yes, few restrictions like sales tax forms, cst headaches etc are gone but this is extra burden by any yardstick.

Ironically, it is very easy to make it simple but they keep changing rules and the businessmen are always in fear when next GST council meeting is announced as to what other f#!up they'll announce next.
 
I used to deal in product which was zero taxed. Now it is 12% taxed. 
But all the companies to whom I supply, they refuse to change the price and insist that I charge them the same rate INCLUDING GST since it is not their problem that my product is taxable now. 

So, my profit is reduced by 12% now. 

I'm not ambani type guy, so govt.won't listen to my problem. 

Now do you understand the GST impact?

when you buy products like meat to which cause carbon emissions you &amp; the producer are doing two things

Ofcourse it will have exceptions. But most likely they won't be religion based. 

For example, Goa follows the Goa civil code, where in most cases, religion isn't the criteria for evaluation.
It's pretty close to the UCC.

Do what you need to survive and be safe. But just remember that not everyone has the luxury of leaving - if the country is to become better, good people have to stick around and make it better.

fj6dzkp,t3_fbqn2v,t3_fbqn2v,"&gt;Well, the simple answer is that it is utopian to think a religion with wonderful rules will translate to wonderful execution of those rules by humans in power. In the hands of the Taliban, who were also trying to enforce God’s way on people, Afghanistan became a living hell. To say that Hindus and Hindu rulers will be different is silly. Christian religious states have exploited people. With a horrendous caste system, Hindu states have oppressed their people too. We will find other ways to divide ourselves, whether it be caste, or region or even sects like Sanatan Dharma and Arya Samaj. If you have hated a community before, you will hate another community later.

&gt;However, there’s another huge problem with India as Hindu Rashtra. We may become one, but we just won’t make much money. History has shown that countries have become rich either because they have been blessed with enormous natural resources or they have embraced modern scientific thinking and lived in social harmony.

&gt;The only rich Islamic countries in this world are those that struck oil. The Middle-East does run religious states and enjoys high per capita income. However, they literally have petro-dollars flowing out of the ground. With so much money, you can get away with it. Without money, Islamic countries don’t do well. Afghanistan, Pakistan, Sudan and Somalia are some examples.

&gt;Hindu Rashtra lovers, unfortunately, have no oil. So unless we discover huge oil pits in Nagpur or Varanasi, we pretty much have only one way to make India rich — hard work, modern science and social harmony. Otherwise, even if you snatch a Hindu Rashtra, you are not going to be a glorious one.

&gt;India’s demographics suggest we just cannot even attempt to re-engineer India’s pluralistic democracy. You cannot wish away 15 crore Muslims or turn them into second-rate citizens. The rise in resentment and therefore radicalism alone will make India a living hell. We also have a very young population, most of which needs good jobs. Hindu Rashtra attempts will destroy investment, business sentiment and harmony.

You said if bombing happens today, it will be justified, which is a sign of radicalisation(as you think you are getting oppressed, and killing others is justified)


&gt;None of which is relevant to me since I don't match any of these patterns

This is another sign, first saying bombing if happens is justified, then saying it's no where close to full blown terrorism, basically trying to justify what you do does not account for terrorism.

&gt;I'm an atheist born in a hindu family

If you had to say ""Hindu"" to make case for you being atheist, then am sorry to say you are not.

2. There are many persecuted minorities living in India who came to India as a shelter before 2014 who are not religiously persecuted but are also victim of political persecution (Tibetians exiled from china or tamilians from sri lanka etc.)  why only religion ? (votebank?)

3. Putting aside all the above facts, Government told the people of India that the people from the neighboring countries face ""persecution"" in their country but to be honest there is nowhere ''Persecuted minorities"" written in the amendment there are direct names of religion-- 6 religions and 3 countries who will be given citizenship who have entered in India before 2014 which is wrong.
When you talk about Humanity religions don't get involved.

What would have happened if they had written religious persecuted minorities instead of it? Muslims would have also been eligible for citizenship. There are Muslims refugees living in India for generations just like of other religion waiting to be recognized as Indian too.

fj6lpjs,t3_fbuo4e,t3_fbuo4e,"* Q2 2019 - The right-wing party BJP won national elections with an overwhelming majority despite doing utterly stupid things in its 5-year term. Three reasons: 

1) terrorist attack right before elections

2) a budget that exempted 3/4^th of tax-paying people from paying taxes

3) incompetent opposition

* Q3 2019 - The new BJP changed status of Kashmir overnight without discussion and consent, and the whole valley has been under military lock-down since August with no internet and fundamental rights suspended

* Q4 2019 - Two things happened: 

a) Supreme Court sided with religious fanatics on Indian history's longest religious case by giving disputed land to those who illegally demolished a mosque in 1992, an incident that led to mass riots and massacres throughout the nation.

b) BJP pushed a bill through the parliament which is the first religious law w.r.t citizenship, and contravenes secularism of Indian Constitution plus protection to tribes of northeastern states like Assam. Mass protests and demonstrations ensued, mostly by students, and we saw the highest number of internet shutdowns throughout the country.

* Q1 2020: BJP lost state election in the capital of India, Delhi, but before that a number of colleges were attacked by hired hooligans who have not been arrested yet despite ample of video evidence. Butthurt offshoots and forks of once banned terrorist RSS organisation, who's the parent of BJP too, went on a carnage in Delhi last week and it soon metamorphosed into a full blown riot. The capital Delhi's protection is responsibility of Union government (BJP) and the carnage went on for three whole days.

Side note: Sedition charges are being filed left and right since last December, Kashmir leaders (who were elected representatives of the people) are detained since August and no one here knows where they are and whether they are even alive.

The only way to effectively control population growth is by educating the populace especially those in poorer regions and reducing poverty. The southern states have fertility rate below replacement level. So population is actually declining in the south and some other states. It's the northern and central states in particular where population is growing and we can't be sure for long that will continue but it should stop growing at certain point and the population will stabilise.,alou404,"""Democracy is kil"" ""no""",t2_2sz2d58o,/r/india/comments/fbtxaz/can_someone_tell_them_what_democracy_actually/fj6qv32/,1583078193,1,0

fj6qwk3,t1_fj6c91k,t3_fb8otw,"&gt;no...bad governance and education system denied them something. Ideally anyone who wants to study and is capable enough should get a chance. 

You quoted occam's razor, but you argue that ""upper caste brahmin families"" don't need reservation because their access to things and their problems are due to bad governance and education system, while you argue in favour of reservation for other groups because it's due to oppression from upper caste brahmins (here you are putting blanket blame on an entire community, despite the fact that many in the community are progressive. But that's an argument for later.) So you use Hanlon's razor when dismissing the problems of one group, but then use occam's razor when judging the whole group without considering everyone as an individual. I am not sure you are arguing in good faith.

&gt; 
&gt;Its tough to discuss without checking your privilege and being able to rise beyond it.

I fail to see privilege in people struggling to put food on the table, because they couldn't afford to not need assistance because they are apparently ""well off"" despite the contrary.

&gt; Not supporting reservations for dalits and tribals is a pretty simple occam's razor, which can tell you which side of the debate the person is on, what his basic framework of understanding is, and what is his caste/privilege background, and how much does his caste identity matter to him.

You fail to apply occam's razor impartially and come off as hypocritical when you assume so much about a person because they are brahmin and upper caste so they will always oppress others. It's not a good idea to use occam's razor when the definition says not to assume so many things.",eskimoFry,,t2_gxd2g,/r/india/comments/fb8otw/how_brahmins_are_inciting_dalits_against_muslims/fj6qwk3/,1583078219,1,0

fj6rt5f,t1_fj6njc9,t3_fbsgp4,"correction: No one ever protested or felt bad whenever anything happened to kashmiris: Hindus or muslims. At the same time that kashmiri pandits were killed and forced out of their homes, scores of massacres killed hundreds of muslims as well. Why make the distinction? Why not bring up kunan poshpora, why not bring up sopore massacre, gojwara massacre, bijbehara massace. All these, and a lot more happened at the same time. All kashmiris suffered, and are still suffering, both hindus and muslims.

Please don't use kashmiri pandits as a tool. None of you give any fuck specifically about them or about any kashmiri in general. They've suffered enough and don't need you to use them as political shields whenever kashmir comes up. If any of you cared any little about any kashmiri, hindu or muslim, including any of the governments, you'd have done more than use the beloved 'but what about kashmiri pandits?' whenever kashmiri sufferings come up for the past 30 years. But what kashmiri pandits were met with is 'kashmir ki khichad humare angan me phenk di' and more comments like these from the same people who now happen to care so much about kashmiri pandits.

Don't bother replying with all the it's islamic jihadist in kashmir who did all this. It's practically copy paste by now and we all remember it word for word. I know nothing is going to change your mind so I won't even bother arguing. Consider this reply a mirror. Whether you want to look into it or not is your call.

fm477mf,t3_fsyd4y,t3_fsyd4y,"In medieval Europe, Jews were blamed so often, and so viciously, that it is surprising it was not called the Jewish Death. During the pandemic’s peak in Europe, from 1348 to 1351, more than 200 Jewish communities were wiped out, their inhabitants accused of spreading contagion or poisoning wells.

The swine flu outbreak of 2009 has been nowhere near as virulent, and neither has the reaction. But, as in pandemics throughout history, someone got the blame — at first Mexico, with attacks on Mexicans in other countries and calls from American politicians to close the border.

In May, a Mexican soccer player who said he was called a “leper” by a Chilean opponent spat on his tormentor; Chilean news media accused him of germ warfare. In June, Argentines stoned Chilean buses, saying they were importing disease. When Argentina’s caseload soared, European countries warned their citizens against visiting it.

“When disease strikes and humans suffer,” said Dr. Liise-anne Pirofski, chief of infectious diseases at Albert Einstein College of Medicine and an expert on the history of epidemics, “the need to understand why is very powerful. And, unfortunately, identification of a scapegoat is sometimes inevitable.”

A recent exhibition, “The Erfurt Treasure,” at the Yeshiva University Museum in Manhattan, displayed a timely and depressing memento of this all too human habit. A chest with more than 600 pieces of gold jewelry, including a magnificent 14th-century wedding ring, was dug up during excavations in what was once a thriving Jewish quarter in Erfurt, Germany. It also held 3,141 silver coins, most with royal portraits; the last king depicted on them died in 1350.

That, said Gabriel M. Goldstein, the museum’s associate director of exhibitions, strongly suggests the hoard was buried in 1349, the year the plague reached Erfurt.

“Why put such a huge investment portfolio in the ground and leave it for 700 years?” he asked. “There was a major uprising against Erfurt’s Jews — records say 100 or 1,000 were killed. Seemingly, whoever hid it died and never came back.”

Dr. Martin J. Blaser, a historian who is chairman of medicine at New York University’s medical school, offers an intriguing hypothesis for why Jews became scapegoats in the Black Death: they were largely spared, in comparison with other groups, because grain was removed from their houses for Passover, discouraging the rats that spread the disease. The plague peaked in spring, around Passover.

But in every pandemic, the chain of causation is intricate. The historian William H. McNeill, author of “Plagues and Peoples,” suggests that ultimate blame may rest with Möngke Khan, grandson of Genghis, who in 1252 sent his armies as far south as present-day Burma, putting them in contact with rodents whose fleas played host to Yersinia pestis, the plague bacillus. After Yersinia returned with them to the flea-bitten marmots of the Eurasian steppes, it began creeping through the rodent burrows lining Mongol caravan routes, which stretched as far west as the Black Sea. That’s where plague-ridden rats boarded ships in the besieged Crimean port of Kaffa in 1346, taking it to Europe.

But that lets off the hook the Indian or Egyptian sailors who had presumably first moved the wild black rat out of India 1,000 years earlier. And then, whom in prehistory does one blame for first carrying Yersinia north from its original home in the Great Lakes region of Africa?

It is not uncommon for ethnic groups to have religious or cultural customs that protect against disease — but whether it was originally intended to do that or not is often lost in time.

Manchurian nomads, Dr. McNeill said, avoided plague because they believed marmots harbored the souls of their ancestors, so it was taboo to trap them, although shooting them was permitted. Butin the early 20th century, trapping by immigrants from China contributed to plague outbreaks.

And Tamils from India working as plantation laborers in Malaysia may have had less malaria and dengue than their Malay and Chinese co-workers did because they never stored water near their houses, leaving mosquitoes no place to breed.

The most visible aspect of blame, of course, is what name a disease gets. The World Health Organization has struggled mightily to avoid the ethnic monikers given the Spanish, Hong Kong and Asian flus, instructing its representatives to shift from “swine flu” to “H1N1” to “A (H1N1) S-O.I.V.” (the last four initials stand for “swine-origin influenza virus”) to, recently, “Pandemic (H1N1) 2009.”

Headline writers have rebelled, and ignored them.

Dr. Mirta Roses, director of the Pan American Health Organization, said that in the pandemic’s early days, she fought suggestions that it be named the Mexican flu or the Veracruz flu or the La Gloria flu after the country, state and town where it was discovered.

“We try to avoid demonizing anyone and to keep the focus on the virus,” she said. “It helps reduce the level of panic and aggression.”

When Dr. Roses was a girl, growing up in a small town in Argentina, her neighbors blamed city dwellers for polio. One summer, families took turns with the local police staffing roadblocks to turn back buses from the capital.

“No one wanted the people from Buenos Aires,” she said, “because they were bringing polio.” (There was some logic in it. Polio, an intestinal virus, peaks in summer, and is more common in cities with overflowing sewers than in rural areas with outhouses.)

“It wasn’t until I grew up that I learned that that was no way to fight it,” she said. “It was vaccinating 99 percent of the children that stopped polio.”

By the old naming conventions, the 1918 Spanish flu probably ought to be known as the Kansas flu. According to “The Great Influenza: The Epic Story of the Deadliest Plague in History,” John M. Barry’s history of the epidemic, the first identifiable cases arose in Haskell County, in Kansas. They soon spread to Fort Riley, from there to other military bases, and then to Europe in troop ships. France, Germany and Britain had war censors controlling news reports; Spain did not. Spain got the blame.

Most human diseases originate in animals. While culling animals sometimes makes sense as a public health measure — for example, culling chickens to stop an outbreak H5N1 avian flu — animals are also sometimes “punished” pointlessly. In May, the Egyptian government slaughtered thousands of pigs belonging to the Coptic Christian minority, despite international protests that doing so was racist against Copts and medically pointless because the disease was already in people. When the swine flu arrived anyway — in a 12-year-old American girl, the first confirmed case — the government vowed to hunt down the last few pigs hidden by poor families and kill them on the spot.

In Afghanistan, Khanzir, the country’s only pig, a curiosity in the Kabul Zoo, was quarantined to keep him away from the goats and deer he had formerly eaten with.

And during the spread of the avian flu around Asia, Thailand’s government shot open-billed storks in its cities and chopped down the trees they nested in, even though the flu had not been found in a single stork.

Though the truth is that diseases are so complex that pointing blame is useless, simply deflecting blame may be more efficient.

During the Black Death, Pope Clement VI issued an edict, or bull, saying Jews were not at fault. He did not, of course, blaspheme by blaming God. Nor did he blame mankind’s sins.

Don't fool yourself, personal income tax in total accounted for abt Rs. 400,000 crores in 2018. Of that, the total taxes paid by those paying a tax of up to ₹1.5 lakh (middle class as less than 1 lakh per month or annual income 11.25 lakhs, without  for an individual) in AY19 stood at ₹66,272 crore. The education budget alone, even though it is quite a small proportion of India's total budget, is more than that. 

Middle class is variously defined as ranging from 4.5-30 lakhs annual income, depending on what definition you look at. I'm not sure what you mean by upper class.
