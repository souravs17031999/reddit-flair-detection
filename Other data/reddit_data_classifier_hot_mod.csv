#####Precautions for prevention of Corona Virus
^Currently ^there ^is ^no ^vaccine ^available ^to ^protect ^against ^human ^corona ^virus ^but ^we ^can ^reduce ^the ^transmission ^of ^virus ^by ^taking ^following ^precautions:

* Do
 * Wash your hands regularly for 20 seconds, with soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub
 * Cover your nose and mouth with a disposable tissue or flexed elbow when you cough or sneeze
 * Avoid close contact (1 meter or 3 feet) with people who are unwell
 * Stay home and self-isolate from others in the household if you feel unwell
* Don't
 * Touch your eyes, nose, or mouth if your hands are not clean

#####How to Quarantine Yourself via [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/06/health/self-quarantine-coronavirus.html)
^If ^you’re ^returning ^from ^an ^area ^that’s ^had ^a ^coronavirus ^outbreak, ^or ^if ^you’ve ^been ^in ^close ^contact ^with ^someone ^who ^tests ^positive, ^you ^may ^be ^asked ^to ^isolate ^yourself ^at ^home ^for ^two ^weeks, ^the ^presumed ^incubation ^period ^for ^the ^coronavirus.

^It’s ^not ^easy ^to ^lock ^yourself ^away ^from ^your ^family ^and ^friends. ^These ^are ^the ^basics.

1. **ISOLATION**: If you are infected or have been exposed to the coronavirus, you must seclude yourself from your partner, your housemates, your children, your older aunt and even your pets. If you don’t have your own room, one should be designated for your exclusive use. No visitors unless it’s absolutely essential. Don’t take the bus, subway or even a taxi.

2. **MASKS**: If you must be around other people — in your home, or in a car, because you’re on your way to see a doctor (and only after you’ve called first) — wear a mask. Everyone else should, too.

3. **HYGIENE**: Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue to cough or sneeze, and discard it in a lined trash can. Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. You can use sanitizer, but soap and water are preferred. Wash your hands frequently and avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth, if you haven’t just washed them.

4. **DISINFECTING**: Don’t share dishes, drinking glasses, eating utensils, towels or bedding. Wash these items after you use them. Use a household cleaner to wipe down countertops, tabletops, doorknobs, bathrooms fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets and bedside tables. That also goes for any surfaces that may be contaminated by bodily fluids.

5. **HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS**: When around the patient, wear a face mask, and add gloves if you’re touching anything that might carry the patient’s bodily fluids. Dispose of the mask and gloves immediately. The older members and those with chronic medical conditions should minimize contact with the secluded individual.

My college has been desperately trying to get approved by NAAC with the top grade. So much that it is making us write non stop paperwork. 

I am in an MBBS College and we are in our internship year. Instead of being given training for being the next doctors of our country, we are being made to create fake paperwork of fake events and meetings that my college wants to claim happened over the last 5 years. We are also being told to make documentation for fake patients and surgeries to show that the hospital is thriving when the reality is actually different. During inspections they pay people to lay in beds.

They are threatening us with not giving us our degrees and increasing our internship periods if we don't do the jobs. We aren't getting any pay (our Salary was supposed to be 5k/mo), and are being made to work for long hours over useless things.

I want to know why my college is so desperate for NAAC accreditation (there's rumors going around that they'll give a grant of 40 crores) and if it is actually a legit organization with strict policies because I want to reveal the fraud that my college is.

2. Install tor browser on your personal laptop (so that when you send an email, the IP can't be traced back to you). Also try to use a public wifi that can't be linked to you.
3. Create a new email ID that can't be traced back to you (try protonmail). Always access this new email address using the tor browser. 
4. Send evidence along with a write up to as many people in this list as you can: http://www.naac.gov.in/contact-us/staff

The purpose cited on the form was Community Testing. I guess I got shortlisted due to my travel history to Singapore. I arrived on 11th March and had no symptoms. 


I got a call from the doctor asking me to come in as my name was chosen randomly to be swabbed. An Anganwadi worker accompained me and they even provided pick up and drop off. The whole process took 30 seconds but the wait was longer because of they were testing from 50 wards today. Doctors waiting in the room in PPE kits swab you in thirty seconds. On a scale of 1 to 10, pain level was at most 6. 


The only cons were, no sanitizers for people waiting. No social distancing maintained (even in the transportation) and no one even asking people to do so. I got looks when I told the guy around me to move away a little bit. Although, everyone was wearing a mask, which is good to see.



According to the officials there, they will ramp up the testing and are looking to test people from every ward in Dibrugarh district over the next few weeks. I wanted to take a video of the procedure but was not allowed. But yeah, it isn't very painful.

Why do you think the congress would had carried the attack in the first place? Arnab is such a vocal critic who has a renowned base through which he spits ""fire"" every night.

Who did not benefit politically: Cong; NCP; Press Council; Editor's Guild.

Who did not benefit at all no matter who planned it : liberal journos and individuals. Because it'll be used to justify every attack on liberal journos from now on. ""wHeRE wErE YoU wHen Arnab etc etc."" > Why do you think the congress would had carried the attack in the first place?

Do you think every action goes only after being approved by leadership? Low level workers take action most of the time without any orders. Congress is pretty sensitive about Sonia Gandhi. Any low level worker wanting to stand out would have indulged in this act. Dunno.. whole thing feels like it was staged by him If you present facts to Arnab, he won't agree - instead he'd call you anti-national.

g76o5f,t3_g76o5f,The real loser in India's errupting Islamaphobia: Caste politics.,16,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g76o5f/the_real_loser_in_indias_errupting_islamaphobia/,9,"TLDR: My (unqualified) opinion is that dalit political movement has seen the most erosion in the anti-muslim appraoch the government has championed.

Note: This post is for discussion. If you have nothing but belligerent responses that add nothing to the conversation I will report you. If you only have worn out, down over a thousand times arguments of being caste blind, having merit and anti reservation nonsense, I will be ignoring you.

Now that I've gotten that out of the way, lets talk.

The anti muslim sentiment grows stronger even in lockdown, with the hindu right finding more ways to demonize muslims everyday. I didnt think it could be possible, but every day it seems they have a new angle of attack. 

And such it has been since day 1 i.e. the day the 2014 elections results came out when the muslim techie was murdered by a hindu mob and that mosque attack happened, I'm forgetting where. The very day of the results. Modi hadnt even taken up PMship that day. 

So to begin, Anti-Muslim rhetoric creates a unified Hindu identity. This is something that BJP has long worked for and was one of the goals of VHP, HM and RSS since their inception - create a Hindu identity that trumps caste indentity so that the caste status quo is maintained while killing any caste discourse. 

Now, I'm muslim. And I have no intention of blaming Dalits for the victory of BJP. Dalits, much like Muslims, have been promised much by politicians purporting to be their champions but delivery has been less than spectacular. Lalu's first term & Maywati's first full term withstanding, no government has been able to delivery upon their promises to their dalit and obc voter very much. So yes, I do not blame these communities for voting outside their 'champions', for 'fracturing' the community vote. 

But the fact remains that Modi's government has done spectacular work for the backward communities (barring muslims). We in urban areas scoff at the Modi governments but their work for the financially weak and socially disadvantaged has been phenomenal. From being called ""Congress + Cow"" it has been jokingly called ""Prakash Karat + Cow"". Such is the success of Modi's socialist policies that I have to begrudgingly accept it as the unequivocal truth.

But coming to the matter at hand, OBC representation in Parliament has been dropping and sarvana i.e. upper caste repesentation is increasing. Now, Dalits have reserved seats so while their count can not decrease, but this seat reservation is working against them. I'm going to copy paste directly from an article here to explain this

[Not a single constituency in India has more than 50 per cent Dalit population, which means it’s always the non-Dalits who decide the fate of Dalit candidates in reserved constituencies. A vocal or assertive Dalit leader has the least chance of winning from such seats. To be re-elected, a Dalit MP must be careful not to antagonise the non-Dalits, and one way of ensuring this is by remaining silent in Parliament.](https://theprint.in/opinion/17th-lok-sabha-looks-set-to-confirm-ambedkars-fears-no-vocal-dalits-in-parliament/232383/)

So who is the loser here? Mayawati has lost her base. There can be no doubt about it. The BSP+SP combine failed because SP votes were transfered to BSP but the BSP vote was not. Why? Because Dalits find BJP a more attractive proposition than BSP.  Who else? Lalu and Mulayam have lost a significant base altho this could be attributed to multiple reasons. It is also less significant because OBC leaders are many. Dalit leaders are few. 

While Chandrashekar 'Raavan' Azad has made a great big splash, he is being kept under hold by the government almost since day 1. He has the appeal to be a mass leader and present a large potential threat to the status quo. But he has been muzzled and jailed as often as was possible. 

Ultimately even the news cycles focus on muslim, and the caste conflicts happeneing everyday take a backseat, all the while forgetting that 85% of Indian Muslims are lower caste muslims. Here too, the muslim identity has trumped the caste identity and they are doubly the losers here considering that most muslim victim to Islamaphobic attack tend to be the under privileged and of backward caste.

This is all by design, mind you. The idea here is the same I mentioned earlier. Maintain caste status quo and the cost of caste identity. And its working.

Note that Modi himself never speaks about caste. Despite being an OBC he never mentions caste struggles and his own caste related experiences. So his being OBC does not bring more visibility to the problems of the oppressed castes.

But, **why do we need ventilators so desperately? Are they the only solution to fight against deadly coronavirus?** According to Brian Oliver, a respiratory disease researcher and an Associate Professor at the University of Technology, Sydney (UTS) the ventilator can decide life and death for severe COVID-19 patients. Like Pneumonia, in COVID-19 lungs are filled with fluid and pus which makes it difficult to breathe. A ventilator becomes the only way to make the respiration process easier by moving oxygen into such parts of the lungs that aren’t badly damaged by the virus.

Edit: after Coronavirus, no country will be what it used to be. There will be change and a period of reconstruction as they try to restore the economy and get back to pre-Covid quality of life. Also factor that into your timeline of when to move. Australia's not particularly racist from what my family and friends there say. To me it would be better than Canada just for the climate, it's warm but no way hot by Indian standards. I can't think of living in Canadian weather.

https://preview.redd.it/cjt1cicmiqu41.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=e226c05d68c73b5d28faccd0aa46ada0cd138105

### Tl;dr

Since remote work, online education, telemedicine, and reliance on e-retail becomes critical for the foreseeable future there is a need for authorities to take specific action. IFF has written to the DoT and TRAI suggesting that these interventions must look toward overcoming the digital divide, appreciating the importance of the internet and mobile services as an essential utility, and protect net neutrality. Towards this IFF recommends concerted stakeholder dialogue, evidence based interventions to support network capacity, efforts to use government funds towards providing free access to internet services to underprivileged/essential cohorts of people, ensuring all areas have access to high speed internet access and expediting the implementation of a net neutrality enforcement framework.

### Background

The lockdown has seen greater reliance of many segments of the populace on information and communications technologies, in particular the internet. People are using the medium for various purposes such as remotely working from home, distance learning, ordering essential items via e-retail, and telemedicine purposes. More generally, people also use it to stay in touch with their friends, family and loved ones, which is crucial to people’s mental health in these trying times.

In various guidances and notifications, telecommunication and internet services have been repeatedly classified by the Ministry of Home Affairs as essential items. In this regard, the importance of internet and telecommunications access has assumed considerable importance during the current public health crisis. It also brings with its own set of policy and regulatory challenges which must be addressed. If unaddressed, we believe there is a risk that the novel coronavirus may exaggerate the digital/technological divide; stress underlying network infrastructure and risk network neutrality.

### Prior Correspondence with the DoT and TRAI

In a letter dated March 18, 2020 IFF previously wrote to the Hon’ble Minister of Communications and copied this to the DoT and TRAI. In it we anticipated that there may be a risk of undue pressure on underlying internet and mobile networks due to shifts and likely increases in network usage. Therefore we suggested authorities:

1. Conduct periodic reviews of telecom infrastructure in consultation with telecom and internet service providers, content providers, startups and consumer facing organisations. Here, we stressed on the importance of preserving principles of net neutrality.
2. Encourage voluntary pledges by telecom companies towards not terminating people’s connections, due to an inability to pay their bills.
3. Urged the Central Government to issue an advisory that States and Union Territories should not issue internet suspension or restriction orders under the Telecommunications Suspension Rules, 2017.

### So Why Are We Writing This Time?

This is because there are new threats which are emerging, since the commencement of our over month long national lockdown.

### 1. Threat to Net Neutrality

In a letter dated March 21, 2020 the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) wrote to TRAI requesting for clearance of charges for voice and data for certain websites and telephone numbers. Additionally, an Economic Times [**report** ](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-news/telcos-suggest-free-access-to-critical-sites/articleshow/74784534.cms?from=mdr)suggested concessions to zero rate certain essential websites pertaining to government services, ecommerce and digital payments applications like the BHIM app, without being charged for data during the lockdown period.

To be sure, TRAI’s Prohibition of Discriminatory Tariffs for Data Services Regulations, 2016, which ostensibly prohibits zero rating of data tariffs in India does allow for exemptions. However, we must consider such developments along with the fact that COAI has also written to online video content providers, to reduce their bitrates to alleviate stress on underlying network infrastructure. By referencing measures taken by online content providers in jurisdictions like Europe, we have noticed that most participants in the Indian market have complied and reduced their offerings to SD bitrates.

These measures have been taken by industry and have been taken with little evidence available to the public of the actual stress being placed on India’s underlying networks, owing to the national lockdown being excessive. India’s internet infrastructure has traditionally been characterised as underutilised, and therefore even according to existing capacities should be able to handle a 20 percent surge in network traffic. This fact may be contrasted with reports which found that mobile internet use (India’s wireline subscriber base remains very less) only increased by 10 percent in the month of March 2020. Pertinently, in Tier 1 metros the increase was even more modest at 3-5 percent.

Thus, it may be concluded that without appropriate review and response mechanisms, there is a threat to India’s net neutrality regime. As such net neutrality in India remains imperfect owing to the fact that we are yet to finalise a definition of what falls under reasonable traffic management practices, and actual means of monitoring and enforcement. This lacuna in the framework has meant internet access providers in India can avoid compliance net neutrality obligations, under licensing conditions, with relative impunity. We have previously [**written to the government about these concerns in March and May, 2019 respectively**](https://internetfreedom.in/net-neutrality-in-india-needs-to-find-its-bearings/).

### 2. Risk of the Digital and Technological Divide

It is reasonable to conclude that the pandemic is sure to hit those working in informal sectors and marginalised communities at large the hardest.

A recent report on [**The Print**](https://theprint.in/india/education/no-gadgets-no-studies-what-online-classes-mean-for-16-lakh-poor-students-in-delhi-schools/406837/) and an article by Mr [**Osama Manzar (Digital Empowerment Foundation, Founding Director)**](https://www.apc.org/en/blog/def-we-need-free-talk-time-and-internet-during-covid-19) are instructive in this regard. The Print article discusses how the coronavirus is shifting students to distant learning situations reliant on online/IVR based classes/educational setups. This means that in areas like Delhi, students from underprivileged backgrounds are at a distinct disadvantage owing to a lack of digital literacy, no availability of supporting equipment in the household like laptops and smartphones, chargers, and no access to high speed internet connections.

Similarly, Mr Manzar’s article also communicates that aside from internet access, many people from informal/marginalised backgrounds do not even have access to basic mobile connections as well. He illustrates this with the recent exodus from urban to rural areas after the announcement of the national lockdown. In it many people travelled in groups-- to the detriment of social distancing protocols.  This is because the availability of phones with talk time to make calls, was often restricted to one or two persons in large groups. And in such times of hardship, the ability to make a timely phone call to a friend or family member can be a question of life and death.

### IFF’s Recommendations

Keeping the above considerations in mind we urged the Ministry of Communications, DoT and TRAI to collectively consider the following interventions:

1. **Regular Review and Reports on Impact of  COVID-19 on Internet Capacity**: India should have twice a week meetings between DoT, TRAI, TSPs/ISPs, internet exchange points, CDN providers, cloud service providers, content providers, small businesses, video conferencing app developers, consumer groups and so on, to ascertain the actual impact COVID-19 is having on internet capacity and quality of service. The findings from these meetings along with support evidence should be published for the public at large. This will be analogous to the approach adopted by European authorities like BEREC.
2. **Consider Means to Expand Telecom Infrastructure Capacity:** Although India’s internet infrastructure has traditionally been characterised as under utilised, Indian authorities must be alive to the possibility that there may be a need to consider means through which it can ease network maintenance and deployment of internet access services. India must consider steps in this regard. For instance, it may consider discussions with TSPs to maintain an open dialogue on the need to expand network capacity, upgrading network equipment, capacity expansions of base stations in mobile networks, etc. It should also consider the need to free up access to particular airwaves to ensure networks are up and running in an interference free manner.
3. **Expedite Final Recommendations and Implementation of TRAI’s Net Neutrality Consultation:** Considering advances being made by internet access providers which seek exceptions to the net neutrality frameworks, it becomes even more imperative that India expedites its finalisation of its definition for reasonable traffic management practices. At the same time there is a need for more robust monitoring, enforcement and institutions. Therefore, it becomes necessary for authorities to conclude its findings on the latest TRAI [**consultation**](https://main.trai.gov.in/consultation-paper-traffic-management-practices-tmps-and-multi-stakeholder-body-net-neutrality) on traffic management practices and a multistakeholder body for net neutrality.
4. **Consider Means for Free Wi-Fi Hotspots, Access to Laptops/Smartphones and 4G Router Availability:** We have urged DoT and TRAI to consider commencing an initiative which deploys funds available under the Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF). Along these lines, we also recommend they consider possibilities of working with the Ministry of Home Affairs and state governments to gauge availability of funds under the National Disaster Relief Fund and State Disaster Response Funds. These funds should be used toward facilitating public wi-fi hotspots, 4G routers, internet devices and so on, in particular targeting benefiting students from underprivileged backgrounds, informal workers, healthcare workers, first responders, and people from marginalised communities. 
5. **Urge industry to not disconnect people’s internet/mobile services, and provide free data during lockdown period:** Indian authorities and access service providers should identify vulnerable groups who would benefit from such targeted interventions, which help with the response but also help bridge the digital divide. We would also suggest TRAI and DoT work together with access providers in ensuring that people can have uninterrupted access to their internet and mobile services even if they fall behind on their payments or recharge schedules. Under utilised funds in USOF may be a useful tool in this regard as well.
6. **Urge States and UTs to Maintain Access Full Speed Mobile and Internet Connectivity During Lockdown:** We urged central authorities to consider ways to limit government powers to issue directives which throttle the internet. Therefore, we recommended the issuance of an advisory which urges states to not issue any directions which suspend internet access or impose restrictions on accessing high speed internet.

And here's my amateur attempt at summarizing the problem:
1. Onions can be harvested only in a few regions, and during a few months of the year. 
2. Every year the harvests cause a glut because everyone sells at the same time. 
3. Unseasonal rains and droughts caused by climate change destroy crops and cause a supply disruption.
4. The destruction of crops, coupled with the lack of storage facilities and unscrupulous middlemen hoarding the crops, leads to a price rise in the later months of the year. 
5. The Government responds by importing onions from Turkey, Pakistan, Bangladesh etc. These onions reach the country after a delay of a few months, and thus depress prices further when the new crop harvests come in for the farmers. 
6. The cycle continues. Farmers have to throw away the produce because of a lack of takers and no storage fac"

Is it a signal that he has served his purpose and now can be done away with..?
Or has he mistakenly questioned his masters (remember how a while ago godi-media was asking questions to BJP which left them fuming) and the masters want to set an example for everyone by mock-atracking him...
Has he asked too much of a price, we do know he got a shiny new office right after elections..?
Is he trying to garner sympathy coz Maharashtra CM has said that people who are giving undue communal angle to Palghar lynching will be taken to task..?

My mom's college has not paid this month's salary yet, to any of the employee. From teachers, to peons and guards. 

Now it's one thing to not give salary to senior staff for whatever reason but for low salaried workers like peons and guards, they might already be going through hell because of lockdown. Not recieving their salary will be a big punch in their gut. 

Can they do this? Didn't the government instructed organizations to not cut salary or lay off employees? Was it just some recommendation or is there a law and people can take action if someone doesn't follow it? 

I'm not mentioning the name of the college (yet) until I have some direction to think. It's a private one in Indore.

No, Govt  ""asked"" the orgs not to lay off or cut the salaries .

Even the schools and colleges need to run on money. Money paid by students as tution fee and donation .

I'm in the UK currently and talking with the locals here, most expect to retire and live out the rest of life at home till a point when then need care and move into a care home eventually. It's normal. I used to think that was so sad. But the more i think the more logical that seems. 
Conversely I think of growing old in India. I don't think I want to burden my family if I have one with my old age at the same time I don't want to end up in a care or oldage home in India which is still looked down upon as a place for abandoned poor souls. My old age is a good 4decades away (statistically speaking, though I might drop dead tomorrow) but in light of the epidemic I just wonder how the end will come and how a choice about where to live life affects the future so much)

Although the news is good, low pollution can also have its downsides. I can imagine how this must be devastating for those who are studying atmospheric sciences because of how the sudden drop in pollution can cause huge problems in their computational models.

Just a few weeks ago, two postdoc researchers from the Ecological Department, Meterology and Atmospheric Sciences reached out to us at the computer science department. We helped them develop sophisticated models in Matlab and launched a weather baloon to capture data about the pollution levels. Assuming that these researchers knew what they were looking for, we helped them implement everything they needed but as it turns out, they were looking to triangulate the position of all the files we store in clouds.

That's when I told them that they're not physically stored in the cloud, but only virtually. This whole endeavor turned out to be a huge waste of time."

So I live in Ghaziabad (Delhi NCR basically) and I am now passed out from this school. I went to buy some stuff a hour earlier and these dogs attacked me. As I am good with dogs I was able to save myself. But it reminded me of something that happened in our school 3 years ago. And it really makes my blood boil that the situation isn't any better. These dogs have been a nuisance for a long time. And before I get hate I want to tell you I am a huge dog lover and I was used to feed strays all the time in my ex society. Just think how these kids must be feeling going to school everyday with a disfigured face which was no fault of theirs. Their poor parents complained to the municipality office but they didn't do shit. Some of us can deal with dogs but just think of a kid or your little brother. His first reflex would be to run and God knows what he can do. My neighbour comes home late from work every night and he is always feels threatened that one day a dog may bite him and this is the problem with India as a whole we just wait for something bad to happen before taking any action. Its pretty frustrating to not be able to go for a morning walk without feeling safe.

And politicians like Maneka Gandhi who probably have never stepped out of her car doesn't know what problem these dogs pose to two wheeler owners and pedestrians. 

I also understand that I can't demonize all stray dogs because some stray dogs are aggressive but do you have a better solution. And look I am a leftist humanist and whatever so I do believe in equality but equality is a vague term. Equality means equality of equals you can't go and ask for reservations that SC/ST gets on the argument that you both are human and equal. So don't give me shit like dogs are equal and tbfh they are not I do agree that they have the right to coexist with us in this planet but humans are the priority and there is no denying that. If you think dog life equal human life you should probably wake from your damn utopia. People like this piss me the most saying ""oh but you can't do that if a human kills or rapes someone you can't wipe of humanity"" but you sure can wipe out that human. In simple words stray dogs are pests that threaten humans and should be dealt with the most humane way possible I also don't support mass killing but people who think there is no problem I hope you get fucking biten.

I think people should report aggressive dogs and they should be killed without any protests through injections.
All females need to be sterilized and all dogs should get vaccinated and stuff so we can decrease chance of rabies.
As population goes down shelters should be built to keep them in the shelters and awareness should be spread that how low maintenance they are and they make a great pet (which is true my dad had one).",utkarshh,0,False,/r/india/comments/g6ndo7/indias_stray_dog_problem/,False,public,Non-Political,,0,0.74,2020-04-23 19:44:09,"  The entire problem is created by Maneka Gandhi and until people start reporting this more, and create a big issue over this, it'll not get solved. People are bigger dog lovers than human lovers and are the ones that stop municipality workers from relocating dogs or taking them to shelters. The dog population is rising unchecked and obviously catch and release isn't working well at all. There needs to be some form of intervention. Feeding strays is not animal love. The day self professed animal lovers figure this out we would be better off.

The stray dog, cows and whatever is essentially a waste management problem.

Clean up the place, neighbourhood, city and strays can be reduced.

But this has to be combined with sterilization. We are talking about 100% sterilization.

Finally the dog lovers of India, can actually start owning Indian dog pure breds. Rampur hound anyone?

Indian dogs adjust well to Indian climate and are equally sharp and trainable.

g6md1z,t3_g6md1z,Geopolitics of Bangladesh liberation war - Why India initially didn't want East Pakistan (modern Bangladesh) to gain independence from West Pakistan (modern day Pakistan ),17,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g6md1z/geopolitics_of_bangladesh_liberation_war_why/,6,"I was researching on this subject recently which revealed some interesting points about the Bangladesh liberation war and the indo Pakistan 1971 war

**1) Indira Gandhi government was of opinion that east Bangladeshi parties coming to power in combined Pakistan assembly would moderate west Pakistan's obsession with Kashmir**

So , I need to give a little background . Before the Bangladesh liberation war really gathered steam , a student protest had already broken our in West and east Pakistan against dictator Ayub Khan . The movement demanded the restoration of democracy in combined Pakistan . When the situation became too hot to handle , the Pakistani military stepped in and deposed Ayub khan . It was decided to hold elections soon .

Now , you need to know that population wise , the population of Bangladeshis in east Pakistan was numerically greater than population of West Pakistan . 

In the elections that followed that , Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his party Awami league won a landslide victory in East Pakistan . They won almost every seat in East Pakistan (awami league lost only 2 seats ) and emerged as the single largest party in combined Pakistan national assembly.Bhutto and his People's party were the second largest but nowhere near majority.

This was a shock election results for the Pakistani military establishment and Bhutto who had thought that west Pakistani dominance in national assembly was inevitable.

The Indian government found this result as optimistic for India . We thought that the Bengali politicians of East Pakistan would care less about Kashmir and would start an era of better relationship with India . Thus as a result , in the initial days of the liberation movement , India wasn't really keen on an independent Bangladesh as that would mean an even more rabid west Pakistan with regards to Kashmir 

**2) Indira Gandhi government was afraid of leftist elements in Bangladeshi independence movement . She was afraid that once they attain independence , they will give support to the Maoist - naxal insurgency raging in West Bengal**

The cold war geopolitics had caused Pakistan to join the side of capitalist America and the west . 

Meanwhile in India , a Maoist insurgency was raging in West Bengal and East India .

Indira Gandhi and her government was afraid that once Bangaldesh attained independence , the left elements involved in the liberation movement would give refuge and support to the Maoist insurgents in West Bengal ( which was not currently happening since Pakistan was on the American side )

As a result , members of Indira Gandhi government were of opinion that it was better if east Pakistan remained part of Pakistan 

**3) Soviet Union was afraid that an independent Bangladesh would be a Chinese ally**

Before the liberation movement , the sino-soviet split had taken place . The communist world was taking the side of either China or Soviet Union .

Soviet Union was afraid that the Maoist section of the Bangaldesh liberation movement would push them towards the China camp .

As a result , Soviet Union warned India against any drastic action in Bangladesh .

They kept this position until Indira Gandhi herself went to Moscow and held a 5 hour meeting with the top leader to brief them on the ongoing genocide in East Pakistan (operation searchlight ) . She also reminded them of their obligation under Indo-Soviet friendship treaty . It was after this meeting that Soviet Union finally changed their position and sided with India 

**4) America was afraid that break up of Pakistan would derail the ongoing negotiations between China - USA which was being done via Pakistan . As a result Nixon threatened India that any war against Pakistan will be expensive for India**

The green Revolution hadn't taken place yet . India had a ship to mouth existence where American aid to poor countries like India kept us afloat . America used to send food package and other relief measures to India regularly . 

If America had suspended those relief packages and placed sanctions on us , we would have been in great trouble . On top of those  , if they had placed more sanctions on us , our economic system would have collapsed .

As a result , we had to take any decision seriously.",ParmanuMan,0,False,/r/india/comments/g6md1z/geopolitics_of_bangladesh_liberation_war_why/,False,public,Politics,,0,0.83,2020-04-23 18:40:52,"  Thanks for this! Was interesting. Such a shame they don't teach us stuff like this in History classes; where History basically stops on 15-Aug-1947 Source(s)/Reference(s) would be appreciated... There is a good book called ""The Blood Telegram"" by a US embassy staffer in Dhaka. 

Also one important aspect of this war is that Pak was the direct middleman in making Nixon-Mao (or is it Deng) meeting happen. Also there was a Vietnam war that Nixon wanted out of.

I know this is not the type of post you would see on here regularly but I don’t know where else to go for advice 

So being a 22 year old guy I obviously use tinder, it never really meant anything I just kept swiping on profiles for no reason but all that changed when I matched with a girl back in November 2019. 

I’ve always thought that relationships were stupid and I’ve never been in one but she changed my view on that, we started dating in December and things were going great but due to reasons I don’t want to mention we broke up in early March, it’s been almost 2 months now and I think I’m finally over her (this was my first relationship) 

I now realise how amazing relationships can be and now I want to be in one and make it work.As of now I’ve deleted tinder because I find it to be stupid due to the massive difference in sex ratio and also I can’t match with the women I find attractive, I just have to sit around and wait hoping that they will swipe on me. I want to change that, I want to take initiative and go out and meet women on my own, I don’t want to depend on online dating 

And here’s the thing I don’t know how to do that. I’m an introverted person and I’m very shy due to this I have very few friends who are also introverted and don’t have much experience in dating. One of my friends suggested that I go to bar and meet women, I’ve never been to a bar before and I don’t drink either but I’m open to that and also I don’t know how to approach women at a bar because I feel indian girls are unlikely to talk to me if I approach them because I’m a stranger, I might be wrong here idk 

I have a cousin who’s a 28M and he’s never been in a relationship and he always keeps blaming women that they’re only after your money and nothing else, due to this mindset he’s been single all his life and doesn’t see the faults within him and since he keeps blaming them he doesn’t take the initiative to change. I really don’t want to end up like him ( lonely and sad ) 

I would really appreciate if you guys can help me out regarding this or share some similar experiences maybe 

And also if there are women reading this, I’d love some advice on how to approach you 

Thank you for reading ! And also please no social distancing jokes, I understand the situation right now

Today, let us discuss the problems with YOUR education system!

&#x200B;

Now to note, there are 4 key points on which I'd like to keep my utmost focus upon-

1. The Reservation System.
2. Non-Skill Based Education.
3. The Indian Parental Mentality.
4. The Rich and the Richer.  


So, in regards to no.1

The Reservation System was the brainchild of Dr.B.R. Ambedkar, President of the   
Constituent Assembly and one of the greatest leaders India has ever seen. He wanted to pull up the Dalits and wanted them to stand face-to-face with the other categories. Noble idea indeed. But the Reservation System remained a good idea in theory but has been executed immensely poorly in India. Instead of providing special education packages to the bottom 50% of Dalits and untouchables, the Reservation System has destroyed any remaining meaning of merit. The most talented people get rejected due to their caste. I believe that the underprivileged should be provided a special educational package so that, they also yearn to study and become something, instead of barely learning anything and being selected for colleges, as a select few do. I believe that everyone has a right to education and shall only be selected on merit and everyone should have a fair chance. There should only be somewhat relief for the poor and economically fragile. (Note: I do not believe in any whatsoever caste system, all people are equal for me and I believe the underprivileged irrespective of caste should be provided a special educational package allowing them to study for free.)

&#x200B;

No.2-

Non-skill based education has rendered Indian students hapless. All Indian schools only teach students theoretically and never teach them the applications of their knowledge. Only garnering a degree is not enough for your success.  Any Indian, if you ask them, to do something ***out of the syllabus*** would be unable to do any such task.  Indians are never thought about how to do something in practice. Practicals only come in 11th grade and that too, not often. Indians are also asked to focus only on academics, not on sports and applications and then we wonder why don't we get as many gold medals and Nobel Prizes as other countries do. The sole reason is, Indians know what is a rat, where to buy rat poison and how it affects the rat's body but are never told how to lure the rat, how to place the posion and where to find the place to buy rat poison.

&#x200B;

No.3-

Indian parents think that there are only four occupations in a person's life, Doctor, Engineer, getting an MBA and corporate and/or Government Services. No other occupations are even slightly respected. Even the last two are to be earned only after, IIT and NEET. If any child even dares to ask his parents to be something else, he is given a tight slap and told to prepare for such competitive exams. Why this mentality, parents? This leads to many kids not being able to fulfill their dreams and leads mass competition with people who are not even interested in the occupation while leaving a vast void for other occupations.

&#x200B;

No.4-

The rich are able to donate to private and rich schools and get their children into the school, while the more deserving are left out because of their socio-economic conditions.

&#x200B;

All in all, the problems are many but yet, we, the Indian Youth, can come together and get rid of such problems. I really don't want any hate on this, these are just opinions but if we want India to develop, we have to give these factors a look. 

Disclaimer: I have no hate against any caste, please do not hate on no.1. I just believe it'd be better to give economic and educational aid to the underprivileged instead, of giving them to just a certain amount of people, in which even the 'creamy layer' takes advantage. All in all, you and I have to bring the change.

&#x200B;

Respect.

I'm only 14 so please don't hate me.


Edit: I forgot to mention that, I do not support caste-based reservation but I do like the idea of economic reservation but in a very limited manner that is.",TheGreatOneAD18,0,False,/r/india/comments/g74qe2/rant_the_indian_education_system/,False,public,Policy/Economy,,0,0.36,2020-04-24 13:58:21,"  1. Not everyone gets that fair chance. Some SC/STs are really downtrodden and they need help. Even I don't like caste-based reservation. I think reservation should be given to all the downtrodden.

2. Don't just blame the schools, the students are also partly to blame. Yes the syllabus is bad, and yeah we are only told to focus on the syllabus, but when you reach a certain age, you should at least be able to think for yourself. I am an FY Engg. student and I see that most of my classmates are really unmotivated, and barely interested in the coursework. They don't wish to explore the coursework, or take any interest in engineering. Majority of them have zero idea about their branch, and only took it because they were getting a good college/weren't getting CSE in a good college. They are getting a lot more freedom and they use it for wasting their time in chasing girls or TikTok, PUBG,etc.

3. I understand some parents are bad, but most of them just want their child to be happy. Unfort"

As a consumer I would probably be happy buying on discount from ecommerce, but as a human I feel very sad for local electronics shops and stores.   


Say, someone opts for dealership of Dell, he would have competition in market because of HP, Lenevo store and so on. Fine till now. Then there would be local shops selling multiple brands. Again fine till now. But then online giants come and sell the same product at huge discount and as consumer even I get excited seeing this but deep down I always know this will ruin the traditional brick and mortar shops. I don't have anyone in my family into electronics business but I feel sad for those who are into this. I can't even imagine about those who actually have to deal with this and how they are dealing during this crisis and how would they deal after it.

Most of them are just selling boxes and they can easily be replaced by online sales.
They lack in:
- pre sales support (no knowledge of products they sell,  seemingly not interested to find out either)
- sales (delivery time)
- after sales support (basically there is none.... you'll have to contact manufacturer)

Note that I am willing to pay more if i can be somehow convinced (presales!) that a shop has good service.

A few shops are exceptions to this. But it is hard for them to survive when a neighbor sells a product much cheaper, but without service. And it is hard to find them. As a kid I was sold a fake PS2 controller, a faulty memory card etc. Since then I've only bought electronics online and the local electronic shops can go fuck themselves as far as I'm concerned. online is cheaper That is true, online shops have driven the margin of brick and mortar shops to the ground cause they have to match the price.

It's a well known fact that lock down slows the spread , buys you time , flattens the curve.
Flattening the curve doesn't mean the total numbers will be less it only means the rate will be slower but longer No shit Sherlock.
The point is to delay the spread so that hospitals are not overburdened with covid cases. Eventually, the spread will reach 80% along with development of the vaccine, so that herd immunity kicks in and cases can be easily managed. Headline does a disservice to what the article actually says - ICMR and NitiAyog had warned the government in early April to use the lockdown to prepare healthcare sector, and that community transmission could not be prevented.

It's almost impossible to get truly unbiased news.

>In regards to the oft-repeated charge of sleeping naked with underage girls, the Rudolphs make two points. One, that such an account is exaggerated (**he only slept with his grandniece, and they were both clothed**) and two, that Gandhi made no secret about what he was doing, and knew it would court controversy.

So, he did ""sleep"" with underage girls. As in, sleep in the same bed, not ""have sex"" Woah. The lie was repeated so often that even I believed it to be true. It was no lie, but a bit edgy. I think he had no wrong intentions else he would not be so public about it. It does align with some misguided oriental beliefs about chastity, humility etc.   


  
I think he did, many disciples and politicians distanced themselves from him due to this

This isn’t a normal fever that gets contained via herd immunity. Herd immunity method can only work if you have a great healthcare system, for a system as fragile as ours it will lead to great chaos. Even UK tried this approach but their infra was saturated. 

Only Sweden has been able to somewhat manage while going through this route.

Also, it is still not confirmed if patients develop immunity to it after first infection. Herd immunity works when you have a vaccine. 95% of the population is immune, and does not transmit the disease to those who aren't immune. For Covid-19, those who are asymptomatic are not immune to the disease but are carriers of the disease. Even if majority of the population is asymptomatic, they're going to transfer it those who aren't.

Second, we don't know the long term repercussions of those who are asymptomatic. So, that route isn't going to work. Herd immunity is feasible only with vaccines. An infection-bas"

Before you start with herd immunity you need to understand two things. Herd Threshold and R.zero factor.

Proportion of immune individuals in a sample set of population above which the disease cannot spread. This is defined as ""Herd Threshold"". Herd Threshold is dependent on the size of the population. Greater the population sample greater the number. 

""R.zero"" typical number of infections passed on by an infectious person. A measure of person to person transmission within herd/community.

When a person or a group of persons are part of an immune herd then the probability of spread depends on the Herd Threshold and the R.zero factor. Chances of an infection spread decrease within a community with larger density of immune people. This can protect those without immunity. People who are affected with the infection will be acting as barriers to spreaders. They may carry but won't spread.  In disease elimination this can b"

https://preview.redd.it/7f60yfc3dbu41.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=295bf3a056f250df993c0705d5545d303816e197

**Tl;dr**

The National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) has sought to revise its Request for Proposals (RFP) for tender bids for the creation of a National Automated Facial Recognition System (AFRS) according to an update on its website dated March 23, 2020. IFF has previously called for a three year moratorium on the government use of facial recognition technologies under its ongoing #ProjectPanoptic. In this instance, we have shared a representation with the NCRB and the Hon’ble Minister of Home Affairs Mr Amit Shah. In it, we highlight legal and constitutional issues with such projects. As a remedy our representation seeks a recall of this RFP and a halt to the tender process itself. It also provides concrete policy recommendations for the Government to consider.   


**Background on AFRS**

The RFP invites bids for the creation of a National Automated Facial Recognition System (AFRS), which has an estimated budget of INR 308 crore, to further create a national database of photographs. According to the RFP, this database is purported to be used to swiftly identify criminals by gathering existing data from various other databases like:  


1. Passport database under the Ministry of External Affairs,
2. Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and Systems (CCTNS) by the National Crime Records Bureau(NCRB) under the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA),
3. Interoperable Criminal Justice System (ICJS) by the NCRB under the MHA ,
4. Women and Child Development Ministry's KhoyaPaya Portal,
5. Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) by the NCRB under the MHA
6. Any other image database available with police/other entities.  


The NCRB first released the RFP calling for bids for the creation of AFRS on 28 June, 2019 (Document Reference: 02/001). Initially, the deadline for submission of bids was on August 16, 2019 (Read our first post on the subject [**here**](https://internetfreedom.in/maskon/)).  However, the deadline for submission has been extended six times due to administrative reasons by the NCRB.  According to an [**update**](https://ncrb.gov.in/sites/default/files/tender/AFRS.pdf) dated March 23, 2020 published on the NCRB’s website, the RFP is now being revised. The current deadline for submission is May 22, 2020.  


As pointed out in our previous [**blogpost**](https://internetfreedom.in/problems-with-facial-recognition-systems-operating-in-a-legal-vacuum/) on the matter, use of this technology without having legal safeguards in place could lead to harms such as discrimination and exclusion which will be difficult to undo. Additionally, in the absence of a strong data protection law, use of this technology could easily lead to mass surveillance. A strong data protection law is needed to hold AFRS accountable in terms of collection, storage and usage of data including sharing of data across government agencies and with third parties to ensure that there is proportionality in processing the data collected. Proportionality during processing of personal data means that only that personal data which is adequate and relevant for the purposes of the processing is collected and processed.   


**Steps taken by IFF**  


IFF has sought a [**three year moratorium**](https://internetfreedom.in/we-have-written-to-the-government-seeking-a-3-year-moratorium-on-government-use-of-facial-recognition-technology-in-india-projectpanoptic/) to be imposed upon all government use of facial recognition technology. IFF has also consistently opposed the use of facial recognition by NCRB since the first report on AFRS came to light. IFF has previously sent a [**legal notice**](https://internetfreedom.in/the-ncrb-responds/) to NCRB seeking that they recall the RFP and halt the tender process since the project lacks a legal basis. IFF would like to thank the NCRB for responding to our previous legal notice and also for their decision to revise the RFP. However, we are of the opinion these steps being taken by the NCRB are insufficient and there is a need for further changes and immediate action.

In this representation, therefore IFF recommends that:  


1. NCRB immediately rollbacks its request for proposals and halts its ongoing tender process for the creation of a National Automated Facial Recognition System.
2. The Government of India place a moratorium of three years on the use of facial recognition technology by government authorities in India during which time an informed consultation takes place between the various stakeholders and civil society organizations to understand the ambit of this technology
3. The Government of India immediately passes a strong data protection law to hold government functionaries accountable when they collect people’s personal data whilst deploying such systems.
4. The Government of India should pass a specific law with regard to facial recognition technology to regulate the technology in the country. This law should be developed as a result of the informed consultation process as mentioned above.  


**What’s Next?**

IFF has been mapping the use of facial recognition all over the country as a part of its ongoing #ProjectPanoptic. In addition to seeking a three year moratorium on the use of this technology, we have been constantly seeking information about these projects all over India and have also been engaging with government authorities whenever the need arises. IFF will be developing and publishing more material as part of our ongoing analysis of this topic under this project in the coming months.

g6omqh,t3_g6omqh,Why some girls keep guys hanging?,0,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g6omqh/why_some_girls_keep_guys_hanging/,22,"So there's this girl friend I had crush upon. When I expressed my feelings and asked her out around 10 months ago, she rejected it. I respected her decision and accepted it but it took me a while to let go all the feelings and recover from that. We stayed as friends even after that, sometimes indulging in flirting (mostly her, mine is just as a response). But since last few weeks, I am feeling she's flirting much more and showing attitude at the same time. And this has brought back all the bittersweet memories and left me confused how to read it! 


Can't share/explain more things on here!

So my questions are:

1. Why some girls keep guys hanging? Have you or someone you know experienced this?


2. Have you expressed your feelings to a girl for a second time after getting rejected fitst time?

Note: I am not generalising here.",Tastypizzzza,0,False,/r/india/comments/g6omqh/why_some_girls_keep_guys_hanging/,False,public,AskIndia,,0,0.43,2020-04-23 20:54:53,"  I can't give you an explanation but can sure offer a suggestion.

Get out of this rabbit hole and run. You're never going to get to be with her. Once you've confessed your feelings and they turned out to be one sided, there isn't going to be any normal friendship between you two. It will always be her flirting or leading you on at her discretion and you, bound by your feelings, will continue to put up with it till you eventually start to look down upon yourself that why were you even tolerating this behaviour in the first place.

Long story short - Katega I don't wanna sound rude but once you express your feelings and she rejects you, then you should not flirt back even when she flirts with you....I think it's disrespectful to yourself in a way (As you mentioned something about showing attitude)

Have more respect for yourself, treat her like you would treat a friend and don't be desperate like ""If you say yes now, I'll come crawling back to you""

Yeah it does sound rude, sorry. I am"

> Rayka Zehtabchi’s short directorial is aimed at unwrapping stigma, fear, insecurity, ignorance and bad education, inherent in a woman’s life. Her tool--a humble looking sanitary pad. The film opens inside a room, two girls in their adolescent years, shying away when asked to talk about menstruation. 

> As is revealed, we all know of it but we don’t talk about it. “Menstruation is the biggest taboo in India”, points out Arunachalam Murauganantham, the social activist from Coimbatore, who is leading the crusade of making India into a 100 per cent sanitary napkin using country.

> We meet characters that champion the filmmaker’s cause. We are introduced to Sneha, Rekha, Shabana and other unnamed heroes of the film that are entrepreneurial, self-sufficient, smart and empathetic. Here, they are not dealing with issues limited only to their village, but are shouting out at the ones that are much bigger than them.

I in no way support dictatorship, authoritarianism or anything like that. I am very proud of our democratic traditions however flawed they might be, you can't deny they have held well since independence and I hope they stay strong forever. This can be said to be a case study.

So Iets start with China which have a single party authoritative form of government. And if you compare our economies till 1980 things were pretty similar. Similar populations, similar gdp, similar poverty levels etc. But in just 30 years China have literally left us in the dust in matters of economy and there is no denying that. Now, I do think we have done pretty well ourselves but it's not enough considering our huge population. The thing is whatever you say about the lack of freedom in China etc etc. There government get things done. For eg. How they cleaned up Beijing's pollution problem with a good laid out effective plan. That's a huge flaw of democracy. The time it takes to reach a conclusion is often devastatingly slow. Now, ofcourse I think democracy is the better form of government as people get to participate in the decision making process. But here stems the first question,
 
Do you think it's good for a country LIKE India?
Once you reach a certain level of development I think democracy is a better choice but do you think for a country like India or a  third world country, a country that is just corrupt and have many problems. Will democracy be a good choice. I mean I can't name many third world countries that became developed following democratic principles (The West is definitely not developed due to democracy. Yeah colonialism I am looking at you.) I think you need a government which can make decisions quick and effectively. Now the whole problem with this is that if we give power to a single party or person no one gets to question them and they can abuse their power for their own benefit. So it can go two ways, Either you get someone like Mao Zedong (Who is a fucking moron) or a Deng Xiaoping (Who is a fucking legend. Literally pulled China out of the junk.) So the second question is,

If you get a smart dictator (like Deng Xiaoping) will you prefer an authoritarian government?
Now with all this will definitely come a problem of shutting a few mouths and stuff as there will always be opposition to change. So some civil liberties will be naturally be curbed in a government of this type. So the third question is, 

Will you be willing to trade your civil liberties with a guarantee that the regime will make the country developed?

We can see examples of this in the Four Asian Tigers. Let's restrict it to South Korea and Singapore. Singapore had a great dictator in Lee Kuan. He changed a small country's destiny in a few decades. (Deng Xiaoping proved it can be done on a larger scale as well). And then you look at South Asia which isn't doing great at all! We have Sri Lanka with their civil war. Pakistan with their Coup. Nepal which isn't doing well and Bangladesh isn't doing well either. Also South Korea later turned to a democracy and I think they are doing great. So the last question is,

Will you accept an authoritarian government if it will turn to a democracy later when things settle down?
(Though this is rare)

So tell me what you think guys! I just want India to be a country that the world appreciate. Because undoubtedly there is no country in the world that will be as great as India once it is a developed country.",utkarshh,0,False,/r/india/comments/g6o9rw/is_democracy_right_for_india/,False,public,Politics,,0,0.37,2020-04-23 20:35:24,"  What's the point if the world starts appreciating us but we lose all our freedoms?

Argh, we can also be Europe or Canada. Democracy may not be right for India but why do you expect that a totalitarian leader or a dictator will be on your side. Germans used to think Hitler is on their side but eventually they too suffered. Not to detract your post but how is India not an oligarchy right now?

INC would definitely blame him. BJP might actually be happy to let him become the scapegoat. > Scindia perhaps thought he would get his share of meat easily, much like it worked in the Congress. But the BJP is a different party. Nothing comes easy, and most certainly not for imports, more so because of the emphasis on the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS)-connect, which these fresh imports lack. I thought this dolt had accomplished his mission by bringing down the Congress government in the midst of Coronavirus crisis. Long term thinking is really rare these days, ain't it right Maharaj sahib? What merit does this buffon have? He couldnt even beat a no name candidate on home turf. So he has to evolve and turn into a Muslim hating, raging, abusive individual. Else he will just be there for no reason hmm, what if he leaves bjp to join back congress in a few months..

There is no set date on when this content will leave Hotstar. I guess it will be timed with the shutdown of Hooq.

Guess it makes sense. WB is following suit to make their own Disney Plus(HBO MAX) and with Disney Plus merging with Hotstar, it shouldnt be totally unexpected that all the Disney-competitor stuff leave.

EDIT - on the TV side too. FRIENDS, Seinfeld, Two and a half men, Big Bang, supernatural already left. And now all the other stuff is going too(except their HBO stuff, of course) Does it mean HOOQs content would disappear from Netflix as well? Can i just say - this is a ridiculously comprehensive list.

But the main problem is of antibody test kits which we have to import from other countries.

Now,
Why India is not able to get sufficient antibody kits ,is it due to shortage of funds ,less seriousness of this pandemic or some other reason.

How Maharashtra government has been able to test more compared to other states ?? How are they able to procure test kits more compared to Madhya Pradesh or other states ?",damnjimmie,0,False,/r/india/comments/g60v2r/what_is_the_reason_india_is_not_able_to_ramp_up/,False,public,AskIndia,,0,0.82,2020-04-22 18:42:32,"  Antibody tests kits are available but these are mostly Chinese, issue with these is that quite a few of them are not working properly. Govt procurement is taking time, some states are moving faster than others. For testing to ramp up, medical bodies like icmr need to accurately determine the accuracy of the test results. With bad accuracy more testing will lead to a disaster Scarcity of will power. Some states (specifically one ...WB) is a slice of China so they refuse to test despite having kits and censor doctors and also fudge the actual number of cases for better optics.

Most of my relatives conflate psychiatry with sorcery. Their thoughts sometimes are repulsive. I've for a while now suffered from self-loathing. This detestation of who I am manifests in my actions.

 I'll sacrifice my desires to please others because there's an ingrained feeling that I'm worthless. It's this irrepressible desire to appease others. That craving for approval maddens me.

I find no joy in my achievements because I tend to compare myself with others. It's indubitable that there'll always be people more successful than us. Intellectually I understand it but unable to internalise it. My acquaintances encourage me to utter affirmations. But they've been sterile. Utterly ineffective.


My passive-aggression repels me. Until not too long ago I wasn't aware of my tendencies. A good samaritan sat me down and elucidated what I was suffering from. I started dispassionately observing my behaviour and I've sensed a pit in my stomach when I don't receive the approval I crave.
I'm encouraged to love myself. But it's a cryptic expression. I've watched countless videos by these soi-disant motivators. The more I watch them the more I hate myself. I've been encouraged to visit mental health professionals. But I cannot at this stage.

   Assuming when you say charging port broke it meant it physical broke. Try asking your neighbours to lend you their laptop everyday for few hours. That’s what I would have done I've seen this issue in a few Dells and HP's. Usually a plastic flap holds the female port in place and that has broken inside, thus pushing the port further in. Planned obsolesence if you ask me.

If you have a screwdriver set, look up ifixit or any number of YouTube videos so you can open the bottom section to expose the problem.

A little bit of superglue and a donor plastic piece (like a toothpaste cap etc) can be used to glue the port in place and add additional structural support.

(Not sure what subreddit this should go in),11,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g609wg/can_someone_help_me_surprise_my_girlfriend_not/,13,"So my girlfriend is Indian and she and I live in the  same city. Due to Covid19, she is unable to travel out of state to visit her family. She got home last night and was frustrated. She said she was feeling “white washed” and was missing home and the culture that comes with being home (speaking Hindi with her family, Indian food, etc). 

So basically I want to do something for her to make her feel connected to her culture even when she can’t be with her family. Something like cook a vegetarian Indian meal and surprise her with it, maybe have some traditional or popular music playing as she comes home while I’m cooking it. Maybe pair the dinner with a Bollywood movie? (She watched one of her favorites last night to feel better). 

I would love any and all suggestions/help. And again, please let me know where to post this if there is a more appropriate sub.

Make sure you make it spicy. She will love that. 

Make tea for her. We love our morning & evening tea. 

Indian chicks love romantic Bollywood movies. She'd appreciate you watching a movie with subtitles with her. Rote learn this sentence and speak in front of her ---- main tumhare bachche ki maa banane waali hoon ! Learn a Dev anand song.Thank me later. Play tunak tunak tun and dance it off. Learn Hindi (Duolingo or some app u r comfortable). Replace commonly used words with their hindi counterparts. 

Cook something ( paneet butter masala/ paneer bhurji or her fav dish if u know ) 

Get a guitar and learn some good Indian song . You needn't know any anything. There are some shortcut videos for Noobs too. Song suggestions - Pehla Nasha , pani da etc. Breakup with her. Not many things will surprise her that much."

Making herbal hand sanitizers:

Baba Ramdev, further shows how one can make an Ayurvedic hand sanitizer at home on India TV. Through this, you can make a hand sanitizer to avoid coronavirus. After thorough research by Baba Ramdev, this domestic and Ayurvedic hand sanitizer has been declared authentic. They say that it is absolutely herbal and it does not have any side effects. Have a look at how to make a home hand sanitizer.

**Ingredients:**

1-liter water

100 neem leaves10-20 basil leaves10 grams alum10 grams camphorAloe vera

&#x200B;

**Procedure**:

* First, put 100 grams of neem leaves in 1 liter of water.
* After that, add basil leaves and boil them well in water. Now put aloe vera in it.
* When the water boils well and about 600 to 700 mL of 1 liter is left, then add camphor and alum in it.

This is exactly the English version of the WhatsApp status which was in Hindi.

So, does thing actually work? If not, then this BS can be more dangerous as it gives a false sense of security and will actually prevent people from using alcohol based sanitizer.

} it might work against bacteria but to disrupt the viral envelope we need alcohols or similar compounds in them (that too in higher concentration about 60% at least if i remember correctly) Sanitizer without alcohol means it is nothing but juice to be applied on skin that does nothing apart for giving you a false sense of disinfection. Camphor?!!! He should be the very last person to be provided with vaccine. As good as gaumutr. 

There has to be a minimum of 60% alcohol content (usually ethanol-wrong) to be effective against viruses. As useful as fair and lovely.

This is a misleading advertisement. Camphor is not a disinfectant. This guy should be punished just like other fake sanitizer factories' owners. Mate, just use after-shave. In general they have a good alcohol content, Old spice for eg has 95.5% (V/V), but idk about the proof of the alcohol. You can blend whatever fruit pulp or aloe vera mix in it.

My family has no objection with her and they're just worried about my safety.

Our families are quite opposite

her younger sister is 20 year old and married, my elder brother is 30 year old and bachelor. (he has no plan of marrying till 35)

Currently I do freelancing for social media marketing and earn $500-2k per month {approx $1k}

we're in relationship for 5 years, we both are kinda shy and sweet. so, we both never had fight with ourselves (or even anyone else as a individual!)

I'm athiest (born hindu) but she is religious and do 5x namaz/day, goes to madarsa but still she is pretty chill and open-minded. I'm into dank memes. she never gets offended in any dark memes of her religion.  (she is unicorn)

Her home is in colony (where her 200-300 relatives lives too). so, there is risk of getting lynched by mob while dropping her or picking her. (because I'm hindu)

&#x200B;

Actually I had no intention of marrying till age 30 but I love her so much that I'm even ready to get circumcision for her. and since she wants to marry. so, offcourse I will. I'm willing to do anything for her.

So, the issue is that my family want me to wait few years but in her family there relatives are recommending her mom to marry her with her cousin. (also, they don't know about our relationship and will definitely be against me)

Firstly, is that a thing you'll actually have to do!? Yikes bro!

Secondly, as a fellow atheist, it sounds to me like you're prepared to sacrifice a whole lot of your values because you're scared of how religious nuts would react to your decision. While you're prepared to lop body parts off, will the girl be prepared to walk away from her family if they don't accept you? Will she be open to registering a police complaint if they force her in any way? Will she walk out of the colony of relatives and stay with you? Dank memes and all is very good. All that means is that she will show an open mind in private. Coming out in public and going against a community is quite another thing. Please try and make sure you don't skin the pig before you know for sure if the level of commitment is equal both ways. Better play out all these scenarios with her in private before you go public.

The only thing is that the journalists need to be briefed in how to navigate these circumstances safely, and some measures should be taken to minimise their contact with potentially affected people. 

Another thing is I suppose that other incidents have not stopped happening because of the pandemic, so journalists do also need to make sure that other important stories are not being missed because of the lockdown. Considering how flooded all news sources seem to be with coronavirus content though, this might need some work. If reporting is not done then how will anyone know what actually is going on. Government, cops and rule breaking elements will have free reign to do whatever they want.

g59jnx,t3_g59jnx,"Why aren't there movies made about important African (Habshi) figures in Indian history? In general, there seems to be so little discussion of Africans and their important historical role in India.",230,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g59jnx/why_arent_there_movies_made_about_important/,186,"So, I recently did a TON of research and made a video on a man named Malik Ambar.  He's an Ethiopian slave who became a de facto king in the Deccan and successfully defended his kingdom against Mughal invasion.  What shocked me is how I would not have ever known about his existence if I wasn't already doing a deep-dive into Deccan history.

His narrative is incredible.

This man was sold into slavery by his own parents, then climbed his way to the top of the Ahmadnagar Sultanate and led a Deccan resistance movement against the Mughal Empire.  Jahangir was so pissed off that he had a painting commissioned of himself shooting Malik Ambar in the head with an arrow.

Why is there so little interest in the Habshi community and their historical exploits?

I mean, Malik Ambar is not even the only one with an interesting story.  There's the Bijapur minister Ikhlas Khan, there's the Habshis who took over the Bengal Sultanate, the independent Habshi pirates of Janjira Island, and more.

Thoughts?

It struck me as particularly strange, as many African communities in India are treated poorly today.  Seems like if more people knew how intricately tied they are to our histories, there would be more respect.

It's a regional empire - most regional histories are underweighted, ignored  in India. This is a major factor

2. It's not particularly resonant with existing state governments and parties in power.  eg maharashtra is shivaji this and shivaji that. No particular state takes up some of these stories now like the sultanate

3. It is not super recent.  History in itself is not told well, except as lip service, rote elements, fables, vague allusions to great indian past/ history, or injustice done by brits , etc etc . Few people really take to studying history.

4. It doesn't bespeak any broad trends in history - eg colonialism, nation state etc.

5. Malik Amber, on the face of it doesn't scream african or escaped slavery background.

There are a lot of people with interesting stories in history whose stories could be told.

If you can tell his story in an interesting fashion, you *should* try. Racism could be a reason seeing how they are treated in society today.

Spec Wise & Price Wise- Mi Trimmer Wins handily 90 Min Run time, 40 lenght settings & IPX 7 Water proof certification v/s 30 min run time & 11 length settings

Product quality wise - Philips is a a little better. the Comb of Mi Trimmer is not as good as Philips and bends a little bit due to which the precision is a little off. When we come to Philips product quality is something which is unmatched

Decision - Mi Trimmer is the smarter buy but Philips is the market leader for a reason. So if you want extreme precision go for Philips, if not go for Mi

Specs are decent 45 min run time but the trim quality is the best I have seen in any trimmer. No competition

**2. Full Body Grooming Kits -**

Philips does not really have a good selection in Grooming Kits

**Economy Segment**

[Beardo All-in-1 Trimmer Kit](https://www.flipkart.com/beardo-pr3058-59-runtime-45-min-trimmer-men/p/itm8713077ee0cef?pid=TMRFKH8DNJFR2DEU) \- A good Product at a affordable price. - Rs 1299

Decent Specs : 45 min run time & 21 Length settings

Similar case as the Trimmer Segment. Nova has great specs 160 min Runtime which is next level while Syska is marginally better in Product Quality and lower in specs 10 length Setting and 50 min run time. No of attachments are same standard ones

My Suggestion is to go for Nova 1153 if pin point accuracy is not required otherwise go for Syska 3052

This one, thank me later

~~One blade doesn't have rechargeable battery~~ Mi Trimmer is the worst. It looks good on paper spec wise. When it comes to getting the job done, it falls short. It gives a shoddy cut. It doesn't matter if it charges quick if it doesn't give one a good cut. So steer away from Mi Trimmer Can you suggest something good that doesn't require maintenance, like oiling and clean up every few months? This is absolutely amazing. Thanks. Great! Would like to see your reviews once everything is available in stock. If you can get your hand on it, I would hands down recommend the Panasonic ER240 BP.

It is one of the rare no nonsense trimmers I've seen. I've been using them since my teens. 

Maintenance is very low, you need two AA batteries (I put rechargeable Eneloops) and they're effective for body grooming as well.

We were to be proved wrong soon enough and we know them as palm civets. Palm civets are a strange bunch of mammals with tails that look like that of the cats. 

We now know that these one of the civets entered our house and crapped all over our kitchen. We initially thought it was a rat until we caught a juvenile palm civet in a trap. I rode to a place full of trees without many people around and released the animal there.

The animal is now separate from its family and probably hiding somewhere. Knowing my parents, they would have had the animal killed merely out of fear. Now, I need to know if I did it right.

Human strife comes from scarcity and selfishness and this crisis is scarcity on an unprecedented level. Discrimination works in eliminating scarcity by prioritising some lives over others. It wasnt naivete. When Muslims are the Jews, we know who is the Hitler and Nazis. As my original point was..voilence did not happen IMMEDIETLY."

Does New Zealand not do repatriation? 

And do you have any evidence, either a written statement or screenshot or recording, of the message that you can only apply two days beforehand? 

What I would personally do is see if there is an email for the embassy and put it in writing that you are getting this message that you have to wait two days and will be abiding by that as per the instructions given to you. 

Most likely, India won't allow international flights until June and will automatically extend the visa, but just in case you face any trouble later, it's better to have documentation that you tried to follow their policies. Chilax, visa will be extended. I thought that NZ arranged 2 or 3 flights from India this week. Don't worry. Right now focus on keeping her safe from Corona. Visa can wait. Relax.

Being an Asian student, the NUS business school is almost a dream come true for me. In any other time, I'd be astronomically excited to join the college and persue my degree.

  


  


  


But situation as it is, COVID-19 means that I am now in a dilemma because of 2 reasons -

  


1. Most politicians and Economists agree that even after the COVID-19 pandemic is under control, the recession it has started will continue. Does this mean that this is not the best time to be graduating from a business school?

  


2. Due to ban on international travel laid down by most countries, I may not be able to travel and attend classes physically. Being able to immerse myself in a developed Aisan work culture and the ability to network with some.of the best students from all around ASIA is one of the reasons why I am persuing the degree and studying for online while living in India is not worth the money I'll be paying for the MBA for me.

  


  


  


What would be your suggestion for me. I have to make the initial payment by the 24th.

Otherwise, is it a possibility to defer to next year? Try emailing them - they are usually responsive. 
Imo it doesn’t make sense to pay the same fee for an online course; that too from a business school where f2f interactions are so important. What’s the initial payment they have asked for btw?

In terms of job I feel it will be more difficult but definitely not impossible to find a job in SG or back in India.

We're the same age, however, she's getting a 2-year Gradaute Degree from the same college here in America where I'm getting my Bachelors from.   
Here's some background information: 

  
1. She's going to make a lot more money than me. It hurts my pride (American who was raised to take care of his family), but I can live with not being the ""primary bread winner."" 

2. I understand that India has a lot of arranged marriages. That's the culture; does not bother me. However, what does bother me is... 

3. Her sister and her mother, and a few friends know about me. But she doesn't want other family to know because she's scared of how she thinks they will think about us, or something like that? She can never really give me a clear answer, but it seems like she's so scared for her extended family to know about us. And that's where the problem lies.   


  
We are already talking about getting married. However, because we are about to graduate, we are not able to stay where we are, because of money. We are talking abotu getting engaged soon, but she has family in America that she can move in with, and I don't currently. I also don't want to be in different parts of the country if we are planning on getting married soon.   


  
So, the help that I am requesting is, what can I do to help her understand how important it is for her to let that family that needs to know about us know, so that we can get things settled? If she wants to wait to tell extended family, that's fine. I understand how different Indian and American cultures are. But, we're planning on staying in the United States, she is wanting to marry an American... is there a way for me to get her out of her shell of hiding behind Indian culture and family politics and understand why it means to me, an American, to know what our future holds without being a complete asshole or jerk? I really love the girl, and do genuinely want to marry her, but the difference in cultures is a roadblock, and it is so frustrating sometimes.

There's a strong division in Indian society between what is public and what is private. Please know that these conceptions are not universal and do not overlap exactly with American ideas. In many Indian communities, dating is now common in the younger generation, but telling your family about a significant other = an engagement. So in an Indian context, for many people, its putting the cart before the horse to announce the relationship prior to an engagement.  
If your relationship is strong in every other way, a reluctance to tell the extended family does not signify a lack of belief in it on her part. Assuming your relationship is in good shape in every other way, she isn't ""hiding behind"" Indian culture, she's doing her best to balance her family's worldview with your worldview, and this takes time and effort. Many people who have to inhabit multiple worlds go through this process.

I need some quick help. I may be going through a SIM swap/hack, and I need to know if its really happening or I am worrying unnecessarily. 

Yesterday I received an SMS for OTP for an Aadhar card which wasn't mine (the last 4 digits were different). So, I shrugged it off. It didn't occur to me that someone else managed to register my number for their Aadhar.

Today, I received an SMS from Airtel saying that I had requested for a duplicate SIM for my number and I should collect it by contacting local office as xxxx phone number. Only I hadn't. So, I immediately called custom support (had to go through so many hoops, I am kinda angry about that) and asked them about it, and they said that there is no such ongoing SIM change/duplication request for my account and that I needn't worry. On myAirtel app too I don't see any ongoing requests/orders. I tried calling that xxx phone number and it was out of network area.

But I am still on my nerves. How can someone else register my phone number for their Aadhar card? And I don't think it is that likely for Airtel to SMS me about SIM duplication by mistake, and that too the very next day.

Is there something that I am missing? Any recommendations on what I should be doing right now?

Any help is appreciated guys, thanks!

P.S: I checked my own Aadhar card's authentication history anyway, just to confirm, and there are no records for any recent access.",cvrjk,0,False,/r/india/comments/g5cv1j/help_potential_sim_swappinghacking/,False,public,AskIndia,,0,0.94,2020-04-21 16:05:55,"  Oh crap.

The message also said to text STOP to some number and obviously I haven't. How old is your current mobile number?
May be the previous owner of mobile number has registered his Aadhar with this mobile number and was requesting the otp now. !remindme 1 day Well I received a message that Rs.100 is debited from my account but when I checked my statement there was no amount debited."

I have couple of questions and doubts.

1. The  strix g I am looking at comes with a 1TB HHD. Does it have M.2 SSD slot  as well so I can add one ssd later? Maybe I will go with a 512GB SSD if  the price drops a little bit.
2. On  Flipkart it says Lenovo y530 has an expandable ram up to 16GB whereas  strix g has 32GB expandable. So, ofcourse I want to buy a future proof  laptop and 32GB sounds way better than 16GB not gonna lie but I am not  sure even that much amount of ram will be useful.
3. Asus  rog strix g doesn't come with a camera. I usually don't use camera in  India but I am going to college outside India and I don't want to carry  an extra accessory with the already heavy laptop. So, I need a camera  inbuilt if at all possible. Lastly,
4. The battery, I don't know which has a better battery.

Which laptop would you suggest I should go for? Some input would be appreciated. Thank you!

I think we have a lot of wait and see what happens ( in case of an upcoming recession). Tata Elxsi is a good company. Good corporate governance and high ROCE are the main reasons why I am interested. But they rely heavily on Automotive sector. And a lot of their income used to come from JLR which will be hit badly. Have you factored these in your valuation? Lots of stocks to watch out for. Having said that, I'd wait on the sidelines until the dust settles. We are likely to see a massive crash following the earnings season. I have stopped all my SIPs and MFs since my source of income has come to a standstill. My whole portfolio has taken a hit of about 38%.

I have a proposal I would like to put up for validation, so some of us may be familiar with the term ""Socratic method"", for those who are not, it is the way of teaching where you induce curiosity into the pupil's mind, it works on the assumption that all knowledge is innate within us and just requires to be brought out. I have been an avid practitioner and long time beneficiary of this technique. It has not only helped me learn the oddest of concepts (I am a law student, I have to study a lot of odd bizarre topics) but teach them with success as well. Basically it's all about leading the child in right direction of thought, it's about teaching the student how to think instead of what to think. In my opinion, this allows for greater actual learning and less rote learning. I was thinking about it and thought about having some insight from Indian parents and students before going ahead and taking on the challenge to build a platform to facilitate this.

If education makes child question traditions,

No thanks.

If education makes child prone to marrying outside community,

No thanks.

if education makes child stand up to toxic behaviour from elders,
no thanks. Asking the right questions, being objective and prioritizing properly is the right approach. More people should start taking this approach all over the world.

Our current education system puts more emphasis on rote learning and blind compliance to social trends this is wrong. It should ideally encourage learning by questioning, objective analysis of the information , prioritize ones needs and set goals a accordingly. Acceptance should happen by understanding not forced by authority.

There are **four possible explanations**:

1. The epidemic may have struck later than in other countries. Since epidemics have exponential growth at the start, a small delay can have massive effects on the number of cases.
2. India’s 21-day lockdown may have successfully suppressed the epidemic. Physical distancing is one of the best ways to slow the epidemic and, if anything, many have criticized the lockdown for being too draconian in that regard.
3. India has not been able to test enough to count all cases and deaths. Without sufficient testing, many deaths may not be labeled with Covid-19 for official statistics, leading to an underestimation of the severity of the crisis.
4. India may have protective characteristics against Covid-19. Researchers have proposed that the low share of elderly in the population, the high temperatures and humidity in India, widespread BCG vaccination for tuberculosis, or resistance to malaria have helped India escape the brunt of "

It is one of the solutions to try to flatten the curve, to delay the spread. Lockdown has economic impact and a big one. 

In my view, a prudent approach needs to be followed, allowing important industries to start bit by bit, carrying on testing, locking down hotspots, providing for the most vulnerable population while as citizens we try our best to stay at home (go out only on need basis or once in a while), avoid gatherings and maintain social distancing as much as we can. This is what I have been saying since the beginning of the lockdown. The point of a lockdown is to do massive scale testing which we aren't close to doing not even in states like Maharashtra. So basically, you go into lockdown, you identify and contact trace clusters, these communities are tested at atleast 50k per day . Eventually some communities can be reopened with strick quarantines for infected people. This is done in phases till the lockdown is absolutely taken down.

Mob lynching of Muslims get a communal angle because the reason of their lynching is often religious (jihad, beef, or straight up Islamophobia).

The sadhus in Palghar got lynched (allegedly) because the people attacking them belived them to be child kidnappers/ thieves. They didn't got lynched because they were Hindu, atleast there isn't any proof of it.

The mob that lynched the sadhus were Hindus too. We too have earlier communalized by outraging against the lynching of a Muslim because he was suspected to be a thief, although he was not lynched due to religious reasons.

The biggest reason this lynching isn't a outraged upon is because I don't see a single person defending it. Unlike those with Muslim people getting lynched where there are people defending it, but where will dungheads listen to reason. I saw a tweet comparing it with Graham Stains incident. These people will go any length. nothing should be communalised. Wrong sub. I have got a different take on this entire thing. Suppose you have gone there to enjoy a vacation with your girlfriend/wife. You notice some local guys staring at your girl. You take offence. This doesn't go down well with the group of local men.

### Tl;dr

On 31 March, the Foundation for Media Professionals filed a petition before the Supreme Court seeking restoration of 4G internet services in Jammu & Kashmir during the COVID-19 crisis. During the first hearing on 9 April, the Court issued notice to the Standing Counsel for Government of Jammu & Kashmir. The matter was listed again today i.e. 21 April and the Court directed the Government to file a reply to the petition by Sunday i.e. 26 April so the matter could be listed next Monday i.e. 27 April. 

### Background

Foundation for Media Professionals (FMP) had filed a petition before the Supreme Court for restoration of 4G internet services in Jammu & Kashmir on 31 March. The petition was first listed for hearing before a 3 judge bench of NV Ramana J., Subhash Reddy J. and BR Gavai J on 9 April. During the hearing on 9 April, the bench issued notice to the Standing Counsel of Government of Jammu & Kashmir. Read more about the petition and last hearing [**here**](https://internetfreedom.in/sc-issues-notice-in-fmps-petition-seeking-restoration-of-4g-internet-services-in-jammu-kashmir-during-covid-19-crisis/).

Subsequent to the petition being filed on 31 March, the Government of Jammu & Kashmir continued to direct ISPs to slow down internet speed in Jammu & Kashmir to 2G through orders issued under the Temporary Telecom Suspension Rules, 2017. These orders issued on 3 April and 15 April were also challenged by the Petitioner by filing additional applications. 

### Practical Impact of the Internet Slowdown

In addition to challenging subsequent internet slowdown orders, the Petitioner also sought to bring on record personal narratives of hardships faced by doctors, teachers, students, journalists, advocates etc in Jammu & Kashmir due to the internet slowdown. FMP’s Director and veteran journalist, Ms. Revati Laul personally spoke to 13 residents of Jammu & Kashmir to collect these narratives.

>*“I have so many patients who are just able to call me this time. I can’t understand what they are trying to tell me exactly...One said,I have pain in the tummy. The tummy is big. It has around 20 organs inside. So then I ask – is it the upper part of the tummy, is it the right side, is it lower? And it becomes very difficult. It’s not possible to accurately pin-point what they’re saying.”* \-Doctor at Srinagar Government Medical College on need for video facilities  
>  
>*“The universities will hold their exams on time. Then no one will speak on our behalf to say to them – oh, there was no 4G, there were no classes. There will only be exams. Did we get any education? Are teachers being sent to our homes? Is there a door to door drive to ensure that students’ education won’t be affected?""* \- Student at Degree College in Bemina

The Petitioner also produced a comparative analysis of web performance at 2G and 4G speed to help the Court fully understand the practical consequences of the internet slowdown. This technical report was authored by Mr. Prateek Waghre, a technologist and policy researcher who had previously also analysed functionality of whitelisted websites in Jammu & Kashmir. The analysis revealed that tasks on observed 2G speed can take upto 50 times longer and 2G network conditions were well below the minimum requirements of video streaming/video communication platforms like YouTube, Zoom and Skype. In addition to this theoretical analysis, Mr. Waghre also carried out a simulated test which found that some interactive interfaces like the World Health Organization’s Situation Tracker did not function at observed 2G speeds at all. 

### What happened at today’s hearing?

During today’s hearing, the bench inquired about a suo moto petition pending before the Jammu & Kashmir High Court on the same issue. In response to this, the Solicitor General, Mr. Tushar Mehta indicated that he requires time to seek more information about the suo moto petition and suggested that it may also be transferred to the Supreme Court. 

The Court also sought information about the total number of COVID-19 cases in Jammu & Kashmir. Senior Advocate, Mr. Huzefa Ahmadi appearing for FMP informed the Court that the region had 354 COVID-19 cases. He emphasized that this was a matter of grave urgency and the Government had not filed its response despite notice being issued on 9 April. Therefore, he requested the Court to direct the Government to file its reply expeditiously.

The Attorney General, Mr. KK Venugopal sought to justify the internet slowdown by claiming that the region had a serious militancy problem. However, the bench directed the Government to file a proper written response and record its submissions on affidavit. The Solicitor General, Mr. Tushar Mehta accepted this direction and indicated that the Government will file a consolidated report. 

In addition to FMP’s petition, two more petitions seeking restoration of 4G internet services filed by Soayib Quereshi and Private Schools Association of Jammu & Kashmir were also listed for hearing today. Advocate Charu Ambwani representing the Private Schools Association of Jammu & Kashmir highlighted how the education of 27 lakh students was being hampered because they did not have access to high speed internet. In response to a question by the bench, she also stated that most students in Jammu & Kashmir have laptops and tablets so the biggest hurdle is slow internet speed. 

After hearing submissions made by all counsels, the bench directed the Government to file a reply by Sunday i.e. 26 April so the matter could be listed next Monday i.e. 27 April.

I thought for a second, their has been a murder and people are worried more about few people not speaking up for the victims. 
I just went through the tweets of ""liberandus"" and found out that almost every person has commented on the issue and condemned the violence. No one is bound to say anything but saying things responsibly is appreciated. 
The irony is that the replies of the tweets contained even worse comments, just vomiting curses. 
Why so much hate?? Communal violence is a reality and no one is denying it. But not every lynching is communal.

Such a wholesome post. I wonder what the Bhakts will say about this The founding fathers of this great nation sacrificed their life for this kind of inclusiveness. Unity in diversity. Today it’s sad that people are questioning the credibility of such great personalities. It’s appalling how their statues get vandalised and how their credibility is questioned shamelessly.

It's going to be tougher than live class, I don't know about the fees but if schools won't be open for a long time to come then I think online classes will be the way forward to keep the academic year going. Schools should indeed give some concession with fee, as students are not using their infrastructure they are saving enormous expenses on maintenance, electricity and so on.


And online teaching cannot be compared with physical classes.

Schools should ask not more than 50% of fees if schools remain close for next few months.
And mind it schools are only conducting online class as a reason to validate their fee demand they don't care about quality most of schools are using zoom free account and take classes for 40min as it's the limit.

Yes , the record is for hospitalization but it also shows the  persistence of the virus. But did the return from overseas within the last month, or just happen to be people who work overseas? They might have Indian asymptomatic sources of infection. Why do you assume they caught it overseas? Once you assume a overseas source you can only explain it with a scary and perplexing incubation period. Asymptomatic Indian source offers a simpler explanation and a more likely possibility. But yes it also points to asymptomatic cases circulating in Kerala, but this is true for most places in the world with cases by now.

To be honest with you, there are many diplomas in medical jurisprudence all across the law schools in India. 
However, don't do those. 

Those are designed for lawyers intending practice criminal law. Therefore, what you learn in those diplomas is rudimentary anatomy, forensics and medicine. 
Something that'll help lawyers cross examine doctors in criminal cases basically. 

Not doctors. Doctors already study that. In depth. 

There are no courses of medical jurisprudence for doctors that'll teach you laws. 

In fact, I was part of a committee to design such a course for govt Ayurvedic college. That one didn't happen eventually. 

If you want to gain knowledge of law, my advice really is, reading in general, and doing a diploma course around the lines of ""introduction to law"" ..

Now to proceed, I am going to rant about the recent experiences I've had with cops, medical professionals and some common folk.

Starting with cops,
My dad is a cancer patient and has to 2 chemos every month. 
When he is hospitalised one of the family members has to do rounds at the hospital, daily, obviously. 

After the lockdown, at the fuel stations, they stopped giving out fuel to anyone who wasn't a shopkeeper or a pharmacist or the likes (i am not against the initiative but there need to be exceptions) which is why we ran short of fuel in almost all our vehicles that we registered on punepolice.in. Which is why 1 day I had to borrow my cousins bike to visit the hospital and a cop stopped me, and asked for the bar code provided for registration. I showed the bar code and also made it clear that it's not my bike and also showed proofs that my visit was genuine and an emergency, to which the cop hit me with his batton, used language like, ""would it be okay if I took your wife just because mine wasn't home"". Like this is the example he thought of coming up, and for a fact I wasn't strolling but it was important and I did not have a choice but to take somebody else's bike.
These people just need a little power and they fucking cross all limits possible.

Now about the medical institutions, specially POONA HOSPITAL by MANIKCHAND DHARIWAL. 
Last month when my dad was admitted, the ward he was in was filled with bed bugs. Like literally the entire ward, was filled with bed bugs, to such an extent that all patients had to be moved right away and the ward was kept shut for one whole month.
This month after the COVID-19 situation got worse and lockdown was announced, they stopped providing hand sanitizers throughout the hospital, despite of the situation going around, and this is not a shop or just any place but a fucking hospital that charges you app. 1k for a day only for stay.
After the above experience, this week my dad had to be hospitalised again because of the side effects from chemo got worse.
Now, on the second and third day they didn't change his bedsheets. He was left in the same dirty sheets for 3 days, and he is cancer patient, we know how bad their immunity gets once the chemo begins. They didn't provide clean laundry stating that they have run out of sheets, while they have entire wards empty. 
His bed sheets had blood stains and what not for three days as the IV they use needs to be changed daily to avoid infection.
And for this when we tried to voice out, the authorities and the doctors themselves started exchanging harsh words with us, as if it's us who is making the mistake.
And to top this off, they charge the entire bill, not a penny less. We are spending like fucking 7.5k for a day (minimum) , we are trusting these shitheads with the life of our nakama and they have the audacity to treat us like shit.

After the above experiences, I am in a dilemma, like what is it to be someone in power, what fun does one get by behaving like that just because they have the upper hand. Like seriously, is being a plain human that difficult?
These officials may it be a medical or political, do they really have power over us. 
Truth be told, they are whatever they are, because we make them.

TLDR : The world around us either gets better or stoops straight to hell.

Really sorry for your dad’s shitty experience. Power really does go to anyone’s head. Especially the people with minimal amounts of power.

Completely unrelated but you calling your family nakama threw me off. Wasn’t expecting that there. :) Tldr; Duh, yes

Full version : yes definitely. Imagine if you had been in a Mercedes or BMW. No cop would even dare to touch you or your car even. Money and power definitely work everywhere and laws are mostly to protect the wealth of rich and the power of those already in power. Common people are expected to follow the law. Those who question the status quo are branded as radicals and those who follow are rewarded with positions of power. Long story short, you my friend as a middle class Indian don't have any "

Test has its limitations.


Asymptomatic means low viral load. 

Testing low viral load means more false negatives.

More false negatives means more people will let out under an impression that they are not infected. .

They will end up infecting more people .

ICMR already put a statement out in March regarding the same. 

The suggestion is counterproductive. 

They need to quarantine the suspects and test them after 5 days.   It's inaccurate before that as viral load will be low . This is wrong on so many levels!

Rajputs who are now flaunting swords must remember that they not only surrender their swords ,but also gave their daughters in Mughal harem in exchange of keeping their zamindari intact.
The Flag bearer against Mughal shahi were Marathas who were a farmer caste in Maharashtra and definitely they were not Kshatriyas.",damnjimmie,0,False,/r/india/comments/g5czj5/did_caste_system_solidified_during_delhi/,False,public,Politics,,0,0.43,2020-04-21 16:16:29,"  Offering this without any comment.

I'll throw in some non sequitor as well. Mughals were the first in India to give reservations to oppressed castes I assume they had similar system in place like the one seen in Ottoman empire Either ask in r/history or put a serious tag."

My father is having jaundice and needs a IV. 

He went to multiple hospitals yesterday, but no one is ready to take him.

Reasons - Doctors arent available. ""They were not expecting the baby because they were given a date in May and we're in search of a doctor because woman was experiencing the pain. Also Dr Ramya said that the couple did not have any money with them either and they did not speak Kannada and they hesitated to speak with most people.

After both the baby and mother were stable, Dr Ramya said that she called for an ambulance which took them to KC General Hospital.""

Its not anyone's pet per se, but everyone takes care of it. The dog was having an infection earlier and was bought back to life with doctor's help.

Does anyone know how to proceed with this during lockdown? If not attended the injury can cause trigger something and put its life in danger. Its not a very healthy creature due to previous infections. Since its not owned by anyone as pet, we are unsure about proceedings. Any help would be appreciated.

Vet services and ambulances are still functioning, call them up and they will come to your area.

If you're not sure, maybe just monitor the infection, keep cleaning the wound and feeding the dog"
