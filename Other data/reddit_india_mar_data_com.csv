Your brother is eligible for almost all PhD biology/ medicine programs in this country.

Alternatively he can sit for various biotechnology entrance tests. 

also, encourage him to apply and ace CSIR JRF NET. 

This all since you asked for research oriented positions.

As for alternative career choice, manufacturing requires him to join as formulation chemist and spend 2 yrs to gain manufacturing licenses.

&gt; Lobby, organize, work to support the organizations fighting for people's rights, etc.
It's not like other places are just magically better, or that leaving will necessarily guarantee other countries won't become the same way.

&gt; Not everyone's got the energy to do that all the time. (I mean, not even I'm doing as much as I could be.) That's why it's so important that everyone work towards that goal, so that we share the burden of that work and are able to support each other in accomplishing it.

Do what you need to survive and be safe. But just remember that not everyone has the luxury of leaving - if the country is to become better, good people have to stick around and make it better.

We already have three confirmed infections in early phases . They are all cured. Their reports are shared .and studied. Now we have an idea on  how to handle them. 
Unlike china which has no idea of scale , symptoms and nature of pandamic.  

Medical literature is a bit matured now . The fact its not impacting everyone equally is the reason why im suggesting not to panic while advising to be cautious.  Certain aspects specific to china made it deadly . They got it at the worst possible time .

They didnt treat the infected.  They havnt reacted to it as they should.  They even threw the people who took to social media tk highligh the plight , as these rumors would derail the business of new year. Only after  5million people of wuhan left for the other cities,  they realized the impact and started firefighting.

My initial objection was to those conclusions that you were drawing. For example comparing it to SARS which is less infectious or do ebola which requires *direct* bodily fluid contact.

This disease is way more infectious and has a long incubation period. Which makes it much more complicated. There is a reason why even people like Bill Gates are terming it as 'once in a century' pandemic.

Your initial comment was downplaying  the severity and making false comparisons with things like road accidents (Wtf) and diseases which aren't like coronavirus.

The best advice you should be giving is for people to be very cautious, wash hands throughly, and take basic care.

fj6dzkp,t3_fbqn2v,t3_fbqn2v,"&gt;Well, the simple answer is that it is utopian to think a religion with wonderful rules will translate to wonderful execution of those rules by humans in power. In the hands of the Taliban, who were also trying to enforce God’s way on people, Afghanistan became a living hell. To say that Hindus and Hindu rulers will be different is silly. Christian religious states have exploited people. With a horrendous caste system, Hindu states have oppressed their people too. We will find other ways to divide ourselves, whether it be caste, or region or even sects like Sanatan Dharma and Arya Samaj. If you have hated a community before, you will hate another community later.

&gt;However, there’s another huge problem with India as Hindu Rashtra. We may become one, but we just won’t make much money. History has shown that countries have become rich either because they have been blessed with enormous natural resources or they have embraced modern scientific thinking and lived in social harmony.

&gt;The only rich Islamic countries in this world are those that struck oil. The Middle-East does run religious states and enjoys high per capita income. However, they literally have petro-dollars flowing out of the ground. With so much money, you can get away with it. Without money, Islamic countries don’t do well. Afghanistan, Pakistan, Sudan and Somalia are some examples.

&gt;Hindu Rashtra lovers, unfortunately, have no oil. So unless we discover huge oil pits in Nagpur or Varanasi, we pretty much have only one way to make India rich — hard work, modern science and social harmony. Otherwise, even if you snatch a Hindu Rashtra, you are not going to be a glorious one.

&gt;India’s demographics suggest we just cannot even attempt to re-engineer India’s pluralistic democracy. You cannot wish away 15 crore Muslims or turn them into second-rate citizens. The rise in resentment and therefore radicalism alone will make India a living hell. We also have a very young population, most of which needs good jobs. Hindu Rashtra attempts will destroy investment, business sentiment and harmony.

The problem is some people are still delusional about our ""glorious"" past.",xxyyccb,"Pyaar bhut hai, bas paisa chahiye. ",t2_1210z1ut,/r/india/comments/fbqn2v/why_a_prosperous_harmonious_hindu_rashtra_is_an/fj6dzkp/,1583068756,1,0

fj6j2fn,t1_fj6f328,t3_fbqg46,"&gt;I'm not an islamist rightwinger advocating jihad. Nor did I justify bombings blindly (see my first comment)

You said if bombing happens today, it will be justified, which is a sign of radicalisation(as you think you are getting oppressed, and killing others is justified)


&gt;None of which is relevant to me since I don't match any of these patterns

This is another sign, first saying bombing if happens is justified, then saying it's no where close to full blown terrorism, basically trying to justify what you do does not account for terrorism.

&gt;I'm an atheist born in a hindu family

If you had to say ""Hindu"" to make case for you being atheist, then am sorry to say you are not. 

&gt;I say armed resistance to state oppression is a legitimate tactic.

Another sign.

&gt; But because you yourself are a prejudiced person who goes by your own stereotypes, you are unable to think out of the box.

If I dance to your tune then its rosy, having a different opinion is not?

Man, there are lots of red flags in how you think, please get yourself checked asap, dont take it as me criticising you, am just honestly concerned about your mental state here.

It all starts with little things before it takes full fledged shape of radicalised terrorists.

&gt;Yes but by whom? 

Both left &amp; right.

&gt;What is your opinion on hindutva terrorism? 

It might be there it might be not, but it's no were near to where Islamic terrorism is.

&gt;What do you think about people like Kapil Mishra, Anurag Thakur, the ones who shout goli maaro

Intigators from right side, also let me be clear here ""goli maaro desh ke gaddaro ko"" I have no issue with this statement here, treason is crime by death in many countries, I have problem with people labeling anyone against CAA as antinational and gaddar and then using this quote for them, same for people labeling everyone else Bhakt.

1.The basis of giving citizenship on the basis of religion is wrong because we are a secular country --- meaning the state will not make any laws based on religion, CAA is law of citizenship pretty big deal for country

2. There are many persecuted minorities living in India who came to India as a shelter before 2014 who are not religiously persecuted but are also victim of political persecution (Tibetians exiled from china or tamilians from sri lanka etc.)  why only religion ? (votebank?)

3. Putting aside all the above facts, Government told the people of India that the people from the neighboring countries face ""persecution"" in their country but to be honest there is nowhere ''Persecuted minorities"" written in the amendment there are direct names of religion-- 6 religions and 3 countries who will be given citizenship who have entered in India before 2014 which is wrong.
When you talk about Humanity religions don't get involved.

What would have happened if they had written religious persecuted minorities instead of it? Muslims would have also been eligible for citizenship. There are Muslims refugees living in India for generations just like of other religion waiting to be recognized as Indian too.

hat would happen if Muslims had been allowed, how many of them would have got citizenship 5k/50k/100k? Does this number matter to our population of 1.3 billion.

fj6lpjs,t3_fbuo4e,t3_fbuo4e,"* Q2 2019 - The right-wing party BJP won national elections with an overwhelming majority despite doing utterly stupid things in its 5-year term. Three reasons: 

1) terrorist attack right before elections

2) a budget that exempted 3/4^th of tax-paying people from paying taxes

3) incompetent opposition

* Q3 2019 - The new BJP changed status of Kashmir overnight without discussion and consent, and the whole valley has been under military lock-down since August with no internet and fundamental rights suspended

* Q4 2019 - Two things happened: 

a) Supreme Court sided with religious fanatics on Indian history's longest religious case by giving disputed land to those who illegally demolished a mosque in 1992, an incident that led to mass riots and massacres throughout the nation.

b) BJP pushed a bill through the parliament which is the first religious law w.r.t citizenship, and contravenes secularism of Indian Constitution plus protection to tribes of northeastern states like Assam. Mass protests and demonstrations ensued, mostly by students, and we saw the highest number of internet shutdowns throughout the country.

* Q1 2020: BJP lost state election in the capital of India, Delhi, but before that a number of colleges were attacked by hired hooligans who have not been arrested yet despite ample of video evidence. Butthurt offshoots and forks of once banned terrorist RSS organisation, who's the parent of BJP too, went on a carnage in Delhi last week and it soon metamorphosed into a full blown riot. The capital Delhi's protection is responsibility of Union government (BJP) and the carnage went on for three whole days.

Side note: Sedition charges are being filed left and right since last December, Kashmir leaders (who were elected representatives of the people) are detained since August and no one here knows where they are and whether they are even alive.

You quoted occam's razor, but you argue that ""upper caste brahmin families"" don't need reservation because their access to things and their problems are due to bad governance and education system, while you argue in favour of reservation for other groups because it's due to oppression from upper caste brahmins (here you are putting blanket blame on an entire community, despite the fact that many in the community are progressive. But that's an argument for later.) So you use Hanlon's razor when dismissing the problems of one group, but then use occam's razor when judging the whole group without considering everyone as an individual. I am not sure you are arguing in good faith.

&gt; 
&gt;Its tough to discuss without checking your privilege and being able to rise beyond it.

I fail to see privilege in people struggling to put food on the table, because they couldn't afford to not need assistance because they are apparently ""well off"" despite the contrary.

&gt; Not supporting reservations for dalits and tribals is a pretty simple occam's razor, which can tell you which side of the debate the person is on, what his basic framework of understanding is, and what is his caste/privilege background, and how much does his caste identity matter to him.

You fail to apply occam's razor impartially and come off as hypocritical when you assume so much about a person because they are brahmin and upper caste so they will always oppress others. It's not a good idea to use occam's razor when the definition says not to assume so many things.",eskimoFry,,t2_gxd2g,/r/india/comments/fb8otw/how_brahmins_are_inciting_dalits_against_muslims/fj6qwk3/,1583078219,1,0

fj6rt5f,t1_fj6njc9,t3_fbsgp4,"correction: No one ever protested or felt bad whenever anything happened to kashmiris: Hindus or muslims. At the same time that kashmiri pandits were killed and forced out of their homes, scores of massacres killed hundreds of muslims as well. Why make the distinction? Why not bring up kunan poshpora, why not bring up sopore massacre, gojwara massacre, bijbehara massace. All these, and a lot more happened at the same time. All kashmiris suffered, and are still suffering, both hindus and muslims.

Please don't use kashmiri pandits as a tool. None of you give any fuck specifically about them or about any kashmiri in general. They've suffered enough and don't need you to use them as political shields whenever kashmir comes up. If any of you cared any little about any kashmiri, hindu or muslim, including any of the governments, you'd have done more than use the beloved 'but what about kashmiri pandits?' whenever kashmiri sufferings come up for the past 30 years. But what kashmiri pandits were met with is 'kashmir ki khichad humare angan me phenk di' and more comments like these from the same people who now happen to care so much about kashmiri pandits.

Don't bother replying with all the it's islamic jihadist in kashmir who did all this. It's practically copy paste by now and we all remember it word for word. I know nothing is going to change your mind so I won't even bother arguing. Consider this reply a mirror. Whether you want to look into it or not is your call.
