muslims have a muslim personal law which ias applicable to ALL sects of muslims.Now definitely all sects do not approve of some of the provisions of this law and this isn't exactly the **Islamic sharia** which people keep bad mouthing without understanding but has many provisions which may be based on them. A lot of the provisions are very different from Islamic countries

I don't have a problem with UCC actually although i prefer having the muslim law altered itself because certain things are very specific to muslims but if the UCC isn't discriminatory to muslims (which is what i meant when i wrote they'll remove sharia in UCC ) then i have no issues.

The current muslim personal law has many good points which might not be there in UCC.I'd rather have those points for everyone including muslims than have them out under UCC.

The reason is i feel the muslim personal laws are given a bad name just because of such qazis.We've already removed triple talaq too",Spideyocd,India,t2_3kan7z92,/r/india/comments/ewmyeg/underage_girls_for_sale_in_hyderabad_first_as_a/fg6ai2d/,1580561467,1,0

The NY Times for instance has very liberal opinion columnists like Paul Krugman, as well as more conservative columnists like David Brooks. But they and other papers commission other “guest” writers as well, eg this one is written by Rana Ayyub, so out of the gate you know she’s not going to write like, say, Rajeev Chandrasekhar. Also she’s writing for a foreign audience so there’s a limited amount of space for nuance.

If you want a longer piece on India (also coincidentally featuring Ayyub) here’s a piece by [the *New Yorker*](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/12/09/blood-and-soil-in-narendra-modis-india). 

If you don’t like the WaPo editorial team’s choices, don’t read it. You’re not their target market anyway. But a lot of key people in DC *do* read it and it’s very influential.

And to be fair to the WaPo, the hard reality is that the current government has bid goodbye to any notion of “vikas” and is busy polarising the electorate and the lunatic fringe of the BJP has been given full license to bray on television.

Even deities, rituals, prayers specially rejected the old brahminical order, and envision an entirely different social order.

The history of our country's independence is that our revolutionaries were so fed up of authoritarianism, they started assassinating government officials. 

What is going on in this country is unfair to our people. Our economic policies have been designed to keep us poor. It is simply not possible to compete with the outside world with so many economic restrictions. The outside world already is at least 20 years ahead. 

By the time we legalized computers, Steve Jobs had already founded Apple and Gates, Microsoft. Skype was founded and possibly sold, why BSNL still continued to lobby to keep Video calling illegal.

China, US etc are not going to create jobs or opportunities for us, or for our future generations. 

If each of us don't individually act, we will have total anarchy and chaos, or worse -  we will be destined to live as slaves. 

Economic and social growth comes from rights. Our economic and individual rights are simply not at par with the rest of the world. Without parity in rights, there can never be equality. 

Our country was founded upon this principle of equality - that a person from India/Bharat should have the same rights as their western peer. This is why our constitution has such strong protection for minority rights.

The goal is to show that debates/conversations are often hijacked by a few rather minor problems due to narratives propagated by the Government and the policies that follow those. The goal isn't to trivialise the problems of terrorism and border security - its simply to show that other problems in India don't get as much lip service from the Government.

fg6da9r,t3_ex5y54,t3_ex5y54,"Nothing new here. PM Modi is transferring wealth from the middle class to the poor, because the middle class will anyway vote BJP for nationalism &amp; dislike of Muslims.

&gt; [Modi] has taken from those in the middle to give to those at the bottom, and both are voting for him with equal enthusiasm. The middle classes have emerged as his most rock-solid vote bank. And they happily pay for it.

&gt; the Modi government has carried out probably the most spectacular and efficient transfer, or redistribution, of national wealth to the poor. It is tough to estimate it to the last decimal point, but between housing, toilets, cooking gas and Mudra loans, anything between Rs 9-11 lakh crore was distributed to the poor. 

&gt; this bought enough votes from the grateful poor for Modi to sweep the election.

&gt; the real joke is on the middle classes. Because, as in 2014-19, they’re the ones who will contribute the wealth to be transferred to the poor. To begin with, the finance minister gifted them additional taxes on petrol and diesel in the budget to ‘make up’, hold your breath, for the drop in crude prices.

&gt; This has followed a string of policies that can only be described as “soak the middle class” and not the rich. During the Modi years, Long Term Capital Gains tax (LTCG) on equities was introduced, dividend distribution tax (DDT) was increased, additional tax was levied on dividend income above Rs 10 lakh per year, surcharge on incomes between Rs 50 lakh and one crore was raised (unless you call them super-rich today), import duty on gold increased to 12.5 per cent from 10 per cent, and subsidies were reduced and taken away from the middle class, including on cooking gas.

&gt; That Modi and the BJP can continue to treat the rising and expanding middle class this way shows that they have gamed its mind perfectly. Its loyalty to them is fired not so much by economic impulse as by something more visceral: The resurgent, muscular Hindu definition of Indian nationalism that they have bought into. Add to this the dislike of the Muslim. Many of them may still find lynchings abhorrent, but they are quite happy to see Muslims completely out of the power structure: Cabinet, top government positions, and greatly reduced in Parliament.

&gt; completely forgot the promises Goyal had made to the middle class in his speech in February: Increase in standard deduction, TDS threshold, relaxation of tax slabs. Why should we bother when you will vote for us out of your love for us, while the poor vote with gratitude?

Insurance isn't a public good and it's not 60s where private sector didn't have enough funds. No one is telling govt to exit the public goods sector like health, education etc. Just for your information, LIC charges a higher premium than private company in virtually every category of health insurance. So it's not exactly doing charity as you are making it sound. And it uses that fund to precisely bail out failing and misgoverned company. 

In short, LIC is not taking losses for the betterment of its consumers. It's taking losses* for the betterment of misgoverned companies. How on earth do you even bail out a bank which has 30% toxic loans (IDBI).

*When I said taking losses, I don't mean absolute net loss. LIC is profitable. I mean losses in forms of bad investments.

&gt;No because consumers know that they govt won't fail like a private corporation even if they invest in other failing govt assets... This is done all the time really


Yes it's done and it's misutilization of public funds which I wrote in the next part of the sentence which you deliberately truncated. Govt assets fail because of misgovernance.

fg6dxux,t3_ex6d6l,t3_ex6d6l,"Now that the 2020 budget had been presented, I just wanted to repost an old but very relevant article. PM Modi is transferring wealth from the middle class to the poor, because the middle class will anyway vote BJP for nationalism &amp; dislike of Muslims.

&gt; [Modi] has taken from those in the middle to give to those at the bottom, and both are voting for him with equal enthusiasm. The middle classes have emerged as his most rock-solid vote bank. And they happily pay for it.

&gt; the Modi government has carried out probably the most spectacular and efficient transfer, or redistribution, of national wealth to the poor. It is tough to estimate it to the last decimal point, but between housing, toilets, cooking gas and Mudra loans, anything between Rs 9-11 lakh crore was distributed to the poor. 

&gt; this bought enough votes from the grateful poor for Modi to sweep the election.

&gt; the real joke is on the middle classes. Because, as in 2014-19, they’re the ones who will contribute the wealth to be transferred to the poor. To begin with, the finance minister gifted them additional taxes on petrol and diesel in the budget to ‘make up’, hold your breath, for the drop in crude prices.

&gt; This has followed a string of policies that can only be described as “soak the middle class” and not the rich. During the Modi years, Long Term Capital Gains tax (LTCG) on equities was introduced, dividend distribution tax (DDT) was increased, additional tax was levied on dividend income above Rs 10 lakh per year, surcharge on incomes between Rs 50 lakh and one crore was raised (unless you call them super-rich today), import duty on gold increased to 12.5 per cent from 10 per cent, and subsidies were reduced and taken away from the middle class, including on cooking gas.

&gt; That Modi and the BJP can continue to treat the rising and expanding middle class this way shows that they have gamed its mind perfectly. Its loyalty to them is fired not so much by economic impulse as by something more visceral: The resurgent, muscular Hindu definition of Indian nationalism that they have bought into. Add to this the dislike of the Muslim. Many of them may still find lynchings abhorrent, but they are quite happy to see Muslims completely out of the power structure: Cabinet, top government positions, and greatly reduced in Parliament.

&gt; completely forgot the promises Goyal had made to the middle class in his speech in February: Increase in standard deduction, TDS threshold, relaxation of tax slabs. Why should we bother when you will vote for us out of your love for us, while the poor vote with gratitude?

Excerpt from Wikipedia article:
&gt;Since the early 1950s, India has debated whether legal pluralism should be replaced with legal universalism and a uniform civil code that does not differentiate between people based on their religion. This debate remains unresolved. The Quran-based Indian Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act of 1937 remains the law of land of modern India for Indian Muslims, while parliament-based, non-religious uniform civil code passed in mid-1950s applies to Indians who are Hindus (which includes Buddhists, Jains, Sikhs, Parsees), as well as to Indian Christians and Jews.[72] In 1955, India revised its Hindu Marriage Act and it applied to all Hindus, Buddhists, Jains and Sikhs; scholars contest whether the law applies to cases where the either the husband or wife is Hindu, Buddhist, Jain or Sikh, and the other is a Christian or Muslim.[69]

[Here's the link](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_law)

Only Muslims have a personal religious law as of 2020.

Hinduism ( as brahminism ) predates Shankaracharya by almost 1500yrs, so you cannot conflate reforms done later to former period. 

Now, Source is Vedas themselves. You can check out ""the history of ancient and medieval India"" by upinder Singh. Read about vedic society chapters.  A really nuanced book about Indian history. Doesn't carry much ideological baggage as many other books. 

Vedas clearly mention the role of purohitas (brahmins ) and Rajan ( Kshatriyas) as heaven and earth with purohitas given the masculine role among the duo, indicating the upper hand during vedic societies. 

Deriving lineage from gods is a norm all over the world. After all, before the evolution of concept of modern nation state, king had to justify his rule often with the help of priests. 

 I'm sure you know about Pharaohs of Egypt. They are considered as living representatives of gods. 
Alexander did it with Zeus and Hercules. Thai and Burmese kings did it with Buddha with Thai kinds even till this day depended on brahmin priests for ceremonies. Ancient Indian kings especially magadha, who dominated most of North India derived their lineage from sun or moon clans. 

One interesting thing is the commie party of China who are officially atheists, continue to believe in the concept of ""mandate of heaven"" which was used by ancient Chinese emperors to justify their rules. This is why they go to lengths hiding calamities like SARS, coronavirus earth quakes as they can be inferred as them losing the mandate. 

Ofcourse, note that Kshatriyas and Brahmins were often in a zero sum game too. With Kshatriyas being the top in certain brahmanas and Brahmins being at top in other instances, clearly shows there was a rivalry between them. In one brahmana, vaishyas were the no. 2 in caste order than brahmins ! It indicates that caste order was not set in stone till the rise of Gupta dynasty and manu smiriti. 

Infact, Jainism and Buddhism were patronised by ancient kings to decrease brahmin influence and rise of brahmins. From these you can infer how brahmins and kings were related in governance. Way too common in ancient India and world.",codenamebk201,,t2_efdmz,/r/india/comments/ewz5ue/ashoka_the_great_rise_of_the_mauryan_empire/fg6hoes/,1580568253,1,0

Seriously, the city is very clean( Indian standards), has nice beach, cost of living is much lower and has facilities rivaling metro cities. Pollution is low unlike the gas chamber Delhi. Only down side is the high humidity will turn you into an oil well. 

Most importantly, the people are super chill and mind their own damn business. Crime rate is low too. There is no religious polarisation nonsense you get to see in North India.

She was quick to say, it angers her everytime she sees men in cap and women in burqa. I told her hating burqa is fine but why hate the cap? We don't hate sikhs because they wear turbans.

You can register as composite dealer and file simple return but no industry will buy from you because the the tax given to you cannot be claimed. 
So, you will be sidelined in favor of big industry players.

If you opt for normal dealer, you have to be VERY careful in submitting returns regularly or else it will never match with your supplier and customer's returns. 

Now multiply it with infrequent power and frequent GST website malfunction and you will almost, just almost give up doing it on your own. 

If that happens, you are almost 5k up every month for outsourcing the returns filing.
 
I know the pain. 

I do it for three of my companies every month and the pain of filing returns cannot be described by writing but I assure you that if you sit with me while I do it, you'll either throw up or bang your fist on monitor in frustration.

I waste five days worth of productivity in a month on average for GST filing. 
So, you see the amount of loss cannot be specified literally.

Also, GST has been implemented on top of other taxes. 
Yes, few restrictions like sales tax forms, cst headaches etc are gone but this is extra burden by any yardstick.

Ironically, it is very easy to make it simple but they keep changing rules and the businessmen are always in fear when next GST council meeting is announced as to what other f#!up they'll announce next.
 
I used to deal in product which was zero taxed. Now it is 12% taxed. 
But all the companies to whom I supply, they refuse to change the price and insist that I charge them the same rate INCLUDING GST since it is not their problem that my product is taxable now. 

So, my profit is reduced by 12% now. 

I'm not ambani type guy, so govt.won't listen to my problem.

Also produce something tangible - projects, reports. And please work in an industry during vacations. Real world Industries just work so different than what's taught. Experience is really valued. 

For placements, well u need to have a no backlog result to get a real University placement. Given that most of the placements offered these days are just no less than scam and fraud.

when you buy products like meat to which cause carbon emissions you &amp; the producer are doing two things

(1) buying meat at whatever price the seller is selling you

(2) imposing a extra cost on third parties who didn't consent to this transaction via carbon emissions

[graph](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcToKzIFUVskw8QTZiLI5CwJ5v-WqdJzFcFyi8YxnhFxN6kDpxR3wuiJjFy7jQ&amp;s=10) looks like this.

So the seller gets to sell more at a lower price &amp; consumers get to buy more at a lower price because third parties bear the extra cost.

In this case third parties are poor people. You're imposing extra cost onto poor people.

There are myriad ways to get the same gram of protein but the amount of land use differs [significantly](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/land-use-protein-poore). switching to more efficient means is better for everyone. Red meat among them is the worst and the most inefficient way to do it.

This is why i say western foof habits are even more parasitic because they impose a higher cost on third parties via emissions + incredibly inefficient land use.

Ofcourse it will have exceptions. But most likely they won't be religion based. 

For example, Goa follows the Goa civil code, where in most cases, religion isn't the criteria for evaluation.
It's pretty close to the UCC.

Btw, I really wasn't trying to be condescending. Maybe it's the way I type. It may look agressive, but tbh, I'm just trying to express my thoughts very clearly ans trying to reduce the possibility of misunderstandings. My English isn't exceptional, so I have no choice but to type like this to convey my arguments correctly.

Fine I watch chotta Bheem and read chacha chaudhary comic books even in my 40s. But that's a healthy one what you said to me. And even I did so. That's pretty common on any forum board debates or anywhere else. We didn't ban each other for such childish stuffs. 

And you still didn't understand what I said earlier, Kamra called arnab a coward, he didn't say ""Goli maaro Arnab ko."" That statement is valid for a 1 year Ban atleast. But you know how it is, that actual Goli maaro guy will just get slap in the wrist. No airline will ever ban that fella who is harm to the society. Also Kamra didn't held a gun on Arnab, that would amount to terrorism charges. So you see my point here, Kamra can very well go against Arnab if he feels what arnab is doing is bad for the country. That's something a reporter does, I have seen it in my 28 years of TV news watching. Kamra infact reminded me of those days when reporters used to heckle politicians anywhere, anytime, anyplace for the greater good.

Global warming happens due to industrialization and agricultural practices. I agree that we should all be taking steps towards a carbon-negative and eco-sustainable world.

On the other hand, the question of non-veg eating in India is not just abstract or academic. Literally, millions of children aren't getting the food they need to be healthy. And this strong veg stance is very harmful for them. For example, mid-day meal schemes are meant to help poor children get some food, as well as be an incentive to go to school. But BJP-ruled states skip the eggs, which are supposed to be part of the meal. This has a very real effect on the development of these children's brains and bodies",jabberwock96,,t2_qso2h,/r/india/comments/ex2g8d/this_is_a_picture_of_reliances_corporate_parks/fg6lwe7/,1580571388,1,0

Poverty has risen. The number of people coming out of poverty was negative last year - based on an analysis of NSO data in Dec. 2019, about 30m people have in fact fallen below the poverty line between 2012 and 2018.

BJP is probably taking from the middle class and giving to the rich, while more or less ignoring the poor.
