"Am I a Hypocrite?  First of all, technically we're all hypocrites.

And I don't think you've done anything wrong by changing your opinion. It's a process: Since you don't know anything about a certain topic because of your own research/efforts, you'll obviously believe what you've been exposed to by others.  Now, when new material comes to light and it hits you that whatever you've been told was incorrect, you'll naturally want to correct yourself. It's called growing up and there's nothing unethical or immoral in that.

When Modi started his election campaign in 2013-14 and went on to blast Congress and Nehru for everything that's wrong with the country, I was taken into it and believed it. Why? Because the country's situation at that point helped to reinforce that idea.  As time went by and I read some history books on how we gained independence, what were the situations/facts/figures in 1947 and how far we've come till now, I started thinking this mindful bashing is uncalled for and drifted away from BJP.

The point is we grow as a person with time and as a result of number of factors, our opinions keep changing throughout our life. The only thing that's important is to keep an open mind and not to lose your conscience, if possible. As per your logic that people never change then yes you are hypocrite, but you see people are always in a state of flux. Saying people are always the way they are is saying that humans were always accepting to LGBT or other races but we know that is not the case through history. At some point a group of people learned different from others and applied to their lives. What I'll say is most people are sheep's and just like everyone else you were till a certain age but forming your own ideas and opinions made you your own person and I don't see that as a hypocritical nature, specially if you can pin point the turning point you had (which you did).

But well what do I know. That’s how literally everyone is. In Delhi, some people ask “what’s your caste?” when they mean “what’s your surname?”.

"Suggesting a new method for admission in undergraduate engineering  First and foremost, this will be totally unfair for those students who were preparing for the entrance exams and focusing very less on board exams.

And secondly, bhai, many Indian professors (specially in IITs) will never remove attendance compulsion. I remember even after my college declared that attendance isn't compulsory (due to corona), my professors were saying they will deduct marks for not coming to class. Only after the government declared lockdown, they accepted that they will not deduct marks. Board corrections is a Sham. You can't realistically compare percentages or percentiles across different boards either. No, not at all. 

Many people (including me) have slogged for the past 2 years preparing for mains and advance. You wish to exchange that with an exam which believes that drawing 4 lines in an LPP as a 4 mark question whereas jee advance, lol. Difficult integrals come for 3 marks. 

Same goes for physics and chemistry. 

Do you think a person who had scored 98%ile+ (who has a decent chance of actually getting into good IITs/NITs or IIITs will agree? (Personally scored 99.3).

Basically nearly 10 lakh students and 10k seats in good streams + good colleges (not demeaning others, but you know what I mean) have to take colleges and you leave that unto chance. Boards checking is just a sham. If your method matches the answer key and your handwriting is good, ayongwith the mood of the external. 

&#x200B;

A better alternative would be to take admission on basis of mains only ( I am against that as well). 1. There are different boards across India. How will you ensure equality?

"Hypocrisy of indian govt. cutting salaries of employees while ordering private sectors to retain all employees on payroll  Kerela government will be cutting salaries of government employees for next five months. All states (and central government) are cutting corners wherever possible. At least salaried people are getting most of their salary with a small cut. Small and medium businesses selling non-essentials have basically zero income these days. There is no guarantee that they may recover in upcoming days and I fear many will have to close their business or go bankrupt. Yes, I was thinking along the same lines. With the kind of business ecosystem this Government has provided for SMEs, they have no right to bring such ridiculous rules. Big corporates can afford to sustain this due to the reserves they possess. Small companies cannot adhere to such practices and why should they? Having said that, I think paying salary during the lockdown is fair because it was just a month and a half. But expecting companies to not lay off someone if there's no business or revenue for an extended period is just idiotic. We are suppliers to automotive companies you can understand our business has turnovers but profitability is not much. It is a labor intensive industry with high overheads. As much as we want to we can’t sustain salary expenses with no revenues. There is no cash flow. Are we supposed to give salaries till we finally go bankrupt. I don’t see banks giving out loans etc easily. The labor union is up our ass. We are so worried. Vote. Them. Out. Remember the day when we banged thalis for police and doctors? Well, those same police officers are getting 30% salary cut to be donated to PM cares. Also, IIRC doctors from AIIMS also had to give up 1 days salary to PM cares. 

Hypocrisy much? They just rolled back an increment temporarily. Rolling back a salary cut is different from rolling back a hike. 2.) It was a request from the government not enforceable law or a show as you put it. Total hypocrisy and mismanagement from the central government. There are cutting down on hike in DA - not salary. The complete premise for your rant is wrong There is a difference between deferment of salaries and laying off people. Do you agree?

"[AskIndia] If you were PM of India and came to know that a foreign country is preventing release of corona vaccine to cause maximum damage to India  A country should fund their own research.

1. Exclusive trade deals, exports goods cheaper to them
2. Provide incentives for their local companies investing in India like tax relief for some period

Homeopathic intervention is bullshit :) The lockdown is helping quite a bit to contain the spread. Plus there are pockets which have flattened the curve. Also lower tests. However in terms of the condition of migrant workers and slums, people are of the opinion that we are resting on a ticking bomb. Hope things get better. Homeopathic solutions are as real and as contemporary as Hogwarts. Homeopathy is not a medical practice, it is based on pseudo science. For some reason the Indian govt continues to actively fund and look upto the AYUSH ministry which actively lies and makes false claims.

Hope you stay safe. Yea Covid-19 deaths are surprisingly low in India. But I also think for some reason, more people might be dying because of pneumonia, diabetes, etc. Whaddya think? Hope you are safe. To be honest, our coronavirus situation isn't as great as the media is showing it to be. The low number of deaths per million is simply because we are unable to test large sections of the population.

The number of deaths per million will obviously show a skewed ratio. However, comparing the number of deaths to the number of infected individuals, we are surprisingly better off than say the United States, or even Italy.

Also, while a lot of people in India do believe in homoeopathy, it is not being used to treat coronavirus. We are using the same methodologies that all countries are following, that is using a broad spectrum of antibiotics to prevent pneumonia, keep the fever down; and using ICU and ventilators for serious patients.

This is a major factor

2. It's not particularly resonant with existing state governments and parties in power.  eg maharashtra is shivaji this and shivaji that. No particular state takes up some of these stories now like the sultanate

3. It is not super recent.  History in itself is not told well, except as lip service, rote elements, fables, vague allusions to great indian past/ history, or injustice done by brits , etc etc . Few people really take to studying history.

Empires are known for trying to suppress regionalism by glorifying some selected part of history and culture while ignoring others. The narrative is set by the elites who control the key powers.

The history of the Habshi is not important in the grand scheme of things and so was ignored. There are many such fascinating events and characters in our history which are kept under shadow.

For example, how much people know about Gopal, the founder of the Pala empire who was elected by the people as the king of Bengal? Also the Siddis of Janjira. Perhaps the only unconquered fort in medieval to modern times. They successfully defended that island fort against full might of Marathas and Europeans alike. Definitely think it's racism. Because I feel that Indians are kinda racist to everyone but white people. Isn't Habshi a slur? History in general is extremely vast. And for a place like India that has such diversity and immense depth, you're bound to have thousands of stories and people left out of the popular narrative. Regional histories are ignored for the most part in Indian curriculum. The stories told by family and local art forms/movies were our only sources of regional history, even to this day in most places. Yea we got the video in recommendation too.

"Indian govt banning investment from China is yet another ""masterstroke"" by Modi - this time, to kill startups.  China is a snake dressed as a puppy. Best blocked. Look how the CCP is protesting now saying that India's protections violate the WTO rules. Where were the WTO rules when lakhs of crores worth of state sponsorship was given to CCP companies to dump products everywhere at prices lower than the raw material costs, simply to kill the domestic manufacturers? You cannot even get a Diwali lamp that's made in India these days, and it is because local makers cannot compete with the state subsidized manufacturing and dumping by China. 

Honestly, if a startup is really good, money will flow in from everywhere. Companies like Paytm are not real innovations. They are data mining operations. Great startups have marquee investors from US, Singapore, Korea etc. We don't need China. 


They have taken over companies all across EU and Australia. They sneak in, then buy it completely. > Paytm to Zomato, Byju’s, MakeMyTrip, Swiggy Ola, Big basket 

These companies are hardly innovative and just do the middleman business but online. Too much VC money is not good for whole business ecosystem. These companies are subsidizing to create mono/duo-poly, and crushing down the other competing domestic startups. We don't want that. 

> Why did mere 0.2% additional investment in HDFC trigger the govt so much? 

HDFC is a [systemically important bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemically_important_financial_institution). In short, a bank, insurance company, or other financial institution whose failure might trigger a financial crisis. They are colloquially referred to as ""too big to fail"". Owning every % of HDFC is like owning a part of Indian economy, So obviously Indian Govt. will loose their shit if China invest more in this company. > Indian startups are among the most innovative companies in the world, and have recorded huge growth despite negligible assistance from the Modi government.

Dude, what the hell are you smoking? Indian startups are mere copycats of Western businesses! Flipkart copied Amazon, Ola copied Uber, Oyo copied Airbnb, PayTM copied Paypal, Zomato copied Yelp, the list goes on!

> 1. Why did mere 0.2% additional investment in HDFC trigger the govt so much? Owning 1.1% of HDFC gets China no say in any matter related to HDFC.

HDFC Ltd. is a lending company with deep ties to the banking sector. Even a 1% stake lets them get into the board, and they get veto powers. A CCP-owned firm having veto powers in one of the largest banking organizations of the country? No, thanks!

> 2. What kind of thought was put into this decision? It's clear that Finance Ministry doesnt put much thought into most of its policies (as evidenced by the downward spiral of economy and key finance ministry portfolio holders more interested in goli maro than economy). But is killing startups during an already fast growing global pandemic crisis really required?

While I agree that the finance ministry is daft in regards to various policy matters since it is controlled by the PMO; a veto against China won't kill startups. What kills startups are their lack of revenue management. Almost all startups are running in losses! How long will financers back these companies? Businesses exist to generate profit; yet most modern startups don't have those plans in sight (both Indian and foreign startups as well).

> 3. What kind of relief will India provide to its startups? Indian govt coffers are already running on fumes. Just to deal with Coronavirus disaster, billions of dollars would have to be spent by the govt that will leave little room for other reliefs. Infact the only way govt can survive is by taxing already tax payers even further. In this situation, is Indian govt equipped to provide any relief to startups?

Why should government systems provide financial aid to companies, both startups as well as established businesses? That whole line of thinking is wrong in my opinion. Unfortunately, the worst precedent was set when government bailed out banks during the 2008 financial crisis. Yes, businesses have been hurt by Covid-19; and a lot of them have incurred losses as well. Isn't it part of running a busines? If startups don't learn to not put all their eggs in one basket, the government cannot help it. The most a government can do (and I am not talking BJP / Congress here) is relax taxation and bureaucratic mess of paperwork to ease startups to get back to their feet. I don't think India has banned investments. They just made it mandatory to seek government approval before its done.

If China is pissed they can take it up theirs.

You just need to look at Australia, if you want to see what giving China free rein could mean in a tough situation. What are the anti takeover laws you are talking about? Do you have an example of any country implementing it successfully? 

Not in a harsh tone, just curious. I do not understand why everyone thinks they are financial experts and the people running the country with advisors who are some of the best experts in their fields are all idiots.

As for answering your question, you have to think bigger and broader than just startups, as an effect of coronavirus there is going to be a recession and most industries would be going into red, so as to avoid hostile takeovers and keep the industries safe the decision was taken.

You should open your mentality a little broader and read about what China has done in Maldives and how much debt Maldives is in right now. You can also Google about what China is doing in Africa.

Post it on twitter on their official handle!!! Never ever use postpaid. It is used to thug customers. That is the reason every company pushes for postpaid sim.

Also vodafone has gone downhill, especially since its merger with Idea.
Vodafone 3G used to be so awesome, But now 4G is shit, congestion and range issues.


MNP to airtel. So much better. Also, when you try to MNP, they will push you to take postpaid, don't. What do you expect from scums who charged 350 per gb before JIO.

Fuck these bastards And I am sitting here with less than 1Mbps Speed on BSNL 3G. Note: 8Mbps=1 MB/s There is a thing called nodal office. i see you contacted them before. Now there's a thing called apellete authority too. You hog them and their twitter with your complaint and threaten to file a former complaint against their former employee. Idk if the threat would work but I feel the nodal and apellete authority is okay. And if nothing works, you just keep your pending monthly amount to minimum, give some advance (500 maybe or a 1000) and ask airtel for mnp. If you don't have monthly balance pending, you can convert to airtel, and then you see if you want to go back to vodafone or not. But I must warn you, they'll start calling you thrice a month to get money from you that you apparently owe them.

Also, it's going to be very tough to get a job offer as someone who isn't even in the country - and coming on a B1/B2 visa to get a job is a very risky undertaking. 30-35 is not too late to do an MS. However given the current situation, I wouldn’t assume that H1B jobs will be available. That said, graduating from a well-regarded MS program has value in itself even if you don’t get a job in the US. And you should never assume that you will — the H1B process is very capricious.

If one relishes a challenging academic program in a great environment — sure, go for the MS. Be prepared to work hard, like really hard, in an environment where your peers are amongst the smartest people you’ve met.

I’d go do the MS if it were me. But the COVID quarantines do introduce a lot of uncertainty. Whereas the PSU option is great for a more relaxed life. In any case, upon PSU privatisation, VRS is likely to be available.

PS. The ECE thing isn’t a problem necessarily. A lot of tech courses involve hardware too, for which an ECE background is very useful.

Don't worry about him contacting family and friends. If he does, he'll get more complaints. And more jail time. Yes but I'm not sure what to do yet about it too. There isn't just one of them, there are multiple of them. I know them from the internet. They look through all of my social media and messages. They play around by changing my nicknames in every groupchat I'm in but only making it visible to my phone, I know this because I asked my other friends if they see my nickname changed on their phone and they always say no. They always change it into something/a subject me and my other friends recently talked about. I also suspect that they also see me through the screen because they drop subtle hints to their messages like ""this is what you did today"" or ""this is what you and your friends have been talking about"". This has been going on for MONTHS, I don't know why they're doing this, but they keep mocking me. What should we do? Ghost him, block on all known channels, change your mobile number, modify  privacy so that unknown people can't message you, change your email id too gives you less of headache in the long run.

He will eventually run out of fuel after a while I guess your friends already know about that guy. Dont communicate from your side whatever the situation. OP please get in touch with your local police. do not engage with this person anymore. it appears that the more you engage with them, they keep coming back with bigger threats. save all your conversations and threats you have received thus far and use this as evidence when you go to the police. sadly, this has crossed the lines of stalking and has progressed to harassment and even possibly threat to life, etc., which are serious offences under law. 

save all your conversations. block this person from all outlets and delete all your social media. change numbers if you have to. but please go to the police. and you have no need to be scared. I remember a friend of mine from college, had to go through all this ,now she lives in Boston.

She had to change most of her social media profiles to  private ones .and had to change her email id/mobile no form most of the social media accounts. 

this creepy guy knew her email id and mobile no and on days like her birthday,and some festivals he used to send otp's (password reset otp's).

she had to change her email id,mobile no, and the username(she used to use same user name on all social media profiles)

if he have that much of info he must be knowing your home address as well .

i would suggest you to spend more time on the platforms where anonymity is the key feature. and do not use your personal email-id and mobile no on every new online platform you sign up in ,as many of these websites are made by freshers .they do not care about your personal data ,and usually this gets leaked from these website and now on dark web your password,your email id and mobile no are there.

After covid19india.org has been a great success, we can create a similar crowd sourced site to track what Indian companies are doing, who deserves the hall of shame and who is carrying the torch for mankind during this dark hour. ~5600 tests conducted in TN today, out of which 49 are positive. All in the current containment areas. 82 have recovered. No deaths. 4, out of the total ~1000 active cases, are currently getting treatment while all the others are asymptomatic and healthy. Rapid testing kits (Antibody kits) have been distributed to most districts and are now operational. TN currently has 36,000 rapid kits (24,000 ordered directly by the state and 12,000 given by the center) and 1,95,000 PCR kits. It has 2 automated testing machines. Current mortality rate in TN is 1.1%. ICMR's current guidelines are to test those with ILI (influenza like illnesses), SARI (severe acute respiratory illnesses) and any essential workers with symptoms.

For those who are positive, they are checking oxygen saturation multiple times to see if they're having asymptotic hypoxia. They are also taking CT scans and chest X-rays. A person is discharged only if they get 2 consecutive negative tests.

One of the best press conferences I've seen. Good questions and sensible, scientific and direct answers. BMC took swab samples of journalists a couple of days ago and most of the people who have tested positive are television journalists. Not even a surprise seeing as how television journalists were interviewing those who had been put into isolation centres after they had returned from Wuhan. Hopefully they have sense and go into self isolation now.

The government and the Army have placed orders for PPE equipment separately, but they are not being fulfilled as there are no supplies.

Don't get scammed. For payments you will have to go through the advance payment options since the cost is less. For huge quantities you can use the LC [Letter of Credit] option.

\#infosys I was part of a team building a contact tracing app that would have used Bluetooth low energy to detect contacts. The data would have stayed on the users device and if and when they got infected, only then it would be uploaded to the server. I believe same was done in the case of TrueTrace the Singapore governments app. But after arogya setu was lunched we stopped working on it with the belief that when there are more apps on the market, it will hamper the tracing rather than aiding to it. 

That being said, only tracing Bluetooth contacts is enough for detecting possible infections. For figuring out places where people might have chances of infection, government can use the location history export from maps of a infected person or simply ask the infected person about the places they visited. By obtaining that list govt. could easily notify people about possible risk of infection to people who have visited these places during this time. This way there is no need of tracking the location of each individual app user and the data remains in users hand. 

But as the govt app is out now, many team's who were working on the same might have already dropped the work citing similar reasons. We also made a video about the drawback of GPS tracing. Let's hope the policymakers listen and remove location tracking. I will rather die from corona than install an app made by this fascist govt. The app was developed with support from MakeMyTrip I think.

[Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fau9MqmSi0g&feature=youtu.be)


In the video the co-founder of MakeMyTrip explains that the app was developed in partnership with them and he also tries to explain the basic functionality and the privacy concerns behind using this app. Key points to take away:


1. Uses Bluetooth pinging to check for a close proximity to an actual patient provided he also had the app installed. So it's only effective if most of the population has it installed.

2. Uses GPS information to tell the user if he had been in a designated hot spot.

3. Every mobile is assigned a UID and it keeps a record of all UIDs who were in within the Bluetooth range (~10m). If an UID is found positive later, then all the UIDs who have been in close proximity to the positive UID will get a notification.

4. Makes contact tracing process much faster .

5. Data is wiped off from the servers after 30 days at the moment. This is based on the ICMR directions but it something that can change as their directives change. 

6. **MakeMyTrip founder says, that you are free to delete the app and you should definitely delete the app once Covid-19 blows over**. I just dont understand the fuzz over this.

2. It was wrong for the cop to hit you Maybe it is mandatory to wear a mask in your state dude. You should have worn a mask, before going out. It's different in other countries but we are not new here. Also, if not there you would have gone to thee pharmacy where the people could have also complained. Wear good clothes while going outside and don't dress like a bhikari. (Also wear gloves and mask which is the most important)

For him, you are the average joe loitering in the streets. And he treated you like one. You should have worn the mask. 

He shouldn't have ideally hit you, ideally. Unfortunately the cops have had to resort to these methods as they have to behave in manners which appeal to the lowest common denominators in the society, unfortunately. Inspite of all the efforts made to educate people, there are some who still ignore all warnings, or go out without masks. It is illegal for a police to beat even a person who is arrested and is kept in police custody by a court, let alone a person for *making a mistake(your case)* or breaking a law.

Even your parents don't have a right to beat you.

I think it's just a cultural thing. Those we are taught to respect also think that is okay for them to beat us *on the pretext of disciplining us*. For example, parents think that it is okay to beat their children, teachers -> students, police -> citizens, politicians -> govt workers(i.e. police and others). Sometimes, with children, it even transcends immediate family, and siblings of parents also beat the children.

I think that it should be taught that respect goes both ways. Students respect teachers, and converse *must* also be true. In simple terms, every person must respect others regardless of their age, relationship, profession, etc. One doesn't need fancy words, while talking with kids, to show that they respect them, because, just the tone of their speech can.

As I learnt from reddit, *Be excellent to each other*. I have two friends in Gurgaon who had gone out to feed dogs. They were stopped, dragged out of the car, slapped and beaten, taken to the police station, id's photocopied, all their cash taken and started getting calls for PayTM transfers.

Dudes filed a case with PCA. (Look into this based on the state you reside in)

All the money has been returned to their PayTM accounts after several calls from the officer requesting the two to take back their complaint. Police have got no authority to use excessive force unless you are threatening the safety and good order of the society. In this case you weren't. Their action isn't reasonable nor justified.

But we take their power abuse so much for granted that it feels normal. You can't imagine such police brutality in developed nations. It's not at all normal and they bloody should be reprimanded for that. Were you wearing a helmet? If your reason to go outside was not legit, i would understand this obviously. But Tbf no one should use force or violence to make a point. It was totally wrong for the cop to hit you even after your reason to go out was legit. Everyone forgets , its human tendency.

Contact tracing using mobile apps has shortcomings in life or death situations, the government official says. i am a big sceptic of this government and the invasion of privacy with this app.

i was dead against it until I saw the Vox video about the success S Korea had with contact tracing. they were one of the frontrunners of this pandemic in March but have flattened the curve remarkably well with exhaustive testing and contact tracing. Heck, i think India has more cases than them, now.

Contact tracing becomes even more critical in india given the idiots who are using this lockdown period to go play cricket.

"[AskIndia] Why is ""corona virus"" death rate steadily increasing?  When the mortality rate is so high, it only means that we aren't testing as widely as required. While we are capturing all the deaths in the data, we're nowhere close to capturing the actual infection numbers. 

Also, everyone who caught the virus before the lockdown, would be either dying or recovering right about now. Assuming 5% mortality and 60% mild cases, in 100 people who we didn't test or report, we miss 5 deaths but miss 60 recoveries which can skew up the ratio.

 I'm by no means saying the percentages which I mentioned are accurate, just example. Community spread + lack of proper health structure + lack of testing per 1 mil ppl Because it's just the beginning. We will never know actual death rate until we happen to stabilize the spread. Because we aren't testing everyone, we aren't getting many negative cases. Plus some people who died with pneumonia were tested for Corona and it came out as positive. Paracetamol is not in the same league - only for fever so lets set it aside. And whatever else you are mentioning are therapies - not vaccines. They are yet to be proved clinically with trials. Please Google how clinical trials are performed for any vaccine or a drug. Just because HCQ is approved for X disorder doesn't make it eligible for Covid19.

And you are talking about death rate of which place specifically ?  There is no easy answer there too - its a function of your health system and your demographics,  smokers comorbidities.  Also a function of how many percentage idiots of your demographics break these social distancing rules. Look at Kerala - they have an obidient population and look at some of other states. 

If you came looking for a simple answer - I am sorry there is none. 1) It takes appox 10 days for the infection effect to mature. And around 20% patients in India are dying when the infection effect peaks.  That's why you will see death rate increasing after X number of days. These patients who were counted earlier in only infection rate also get added to death rate.

2) After lockdown few cases were caught too late to be saved , for whatever reasons - delays in testing, slow diagnosis etc. So these numbers went directly to death rate and infection rate.

3) Many patients were found post-mortum to be Covid positive, when it was mandated that anyone who died with Pneumonia like symptoms should be tested, these also went directly to death rate and infection rate.",AskIndia

"My experiment with using bumble in India.  Obligatory SIMP comment There is a skewed sex ratio in real life AND on dating websites. Cultural norms are a huge factor here. Basically it comes down to a supply/demand problem. Good insights OP. S to the I to the M to the P. [deleted] I agree that boys are at fault. We can't be so desperate and keep pedestalizing women. The sex ratio is skewed that's true but think of it this way the dating apps are mostly used in urban areas where people have migrated to from other parts, mostly migrants being men (though this eg is mostly used for people in the lower income bracket).

You both should start thinking about the way you will approach his parents.

There are some more details you need to consider.

1) is his family from a big city or small town or a Village. Big city based family might be more accepting.

2) South India has 5 distinct states. Each state has different level of acceptance. 

3) have there already been any love marriages in his close family or his parent's friend group? Usually the first love marriage in their social circle is very difficult to get accepted. 

All the best. Ignore the parents and go to marriage registration office to register marriage. If he refuses, he is simply doing ""time pass"" with you. Leave him.

He isn’t going to marry you.


This is a one of the most bullshit yet most effective breakup tactic here.

“I wouldn’t marry you if my parents don’t agree.” Hi, of course try to convince his parents. It all depends on the level of education and background. South Indians are open minded(well mostly) so no point giving up just now.   
Wish you all the best 😀 You should definitely give it a shot. I'd say you guys shouldn't really bother about how the parents feel. However, if you really feel they should have a say in your affairs, you may give his parents a shot although it would not be the wisest thing to do. I am a south Indian guy (31, Catholic) and live with my girlfriend who is from east India and is a Hindu. Although my parents are more or less liberal and city-bred, but they weren't happy that I decided to live in with my partner. I didn't give my parents an option and decided to do what I wanted. Although they came around eventually - but I wasn't too concerned about how they felt.

It is sometimes hard to convince Indian parents about simple matters of love. The very fact that a generation of Indian parents arrange marriages for their kids betrays how much store they place on brahminical patriarchal norms of marrying within their social groups, especially caste.

How does your partner feel about his parents? In case he skirts an open conversation about his parents and is not open to discussing how he feels about them and their views on marriage, it means they are conservative and would be a bit difficult changing their mindsets. Marry him worry about his parents later. If the guy suddenly doesn't want to marry you because his parents say no then you must judge him for it and walk away So A Little ,random , genuine and authentic question

The people that are exhibiting such stupidity are to solely held responsible for their actions. We have seen this with everything where if the government takes action against such stupidity, it almost always backfires. This is the reality and I’m in no way defending the current government but we cannot foolishly just blame an entity for everything that we deem wrong in the country. Hi I have a few points for this and I will edit this comment as I add them.

The thali bajao was to show appreciation for doctors, however do you think people did it because of that. For them it was just another party or entertainment, to them doctors meant jack shit. Others did it because they thought that it would kill Corona. The very next day a doctor is Surat was threatened by her neighbour, what the hell was the neighbors problem I don't know, if he didn't want to meet her he could have just stayed in his home. 

You have also mentioned that doctors are a hated community in india, that is not so, Indians hate everybody, today they are doctors and tomorrow it may be someone else, look at Kejriwal, he built hospitals and mohala clinics in Delhi, the same hospitals and clinics that will are coming useful now, imagine our position if we did not have them and government hospitals had poor facilities, still the centre tried everything in their power that mohala clinics and hospitals did not get built. People hated Kejriwal for this and mocked him to no end, especially the middle class, who are the people now assaulting doctors. So in conclusion Indians hate everyone. To be honest I would be glad if a doctor was a neighbor during such times, in case of any emergency I would get priority. Also a doctor would never infect his family.

Coming to the judiciary, yes these people don't know how things work, they may know but may not care, most of these judges, but not all, consider themselves to be high and mighty and they run over the common man without a second thought, especially if their paymasters like Adani and Ambani command them to.

However, what I am personally seeing around is that whenever I doubt our current system and ask uncomfortable questions about it, the immediate reply is 'So what's the solution?' and I may not have a solution. Then it immediately turns me into 'person who is always critical'. I believe this is a big problem. If we continue this way we'll never get to the answer as the questions are not being asked and we'll always be stuck with current problems. I agree with this. People don't feel the need to question basic stuff like 'Is what I just heard/read/saw actually true?' They have been imparted with this ignorance since their childhood and they keep believing it. They never get outside of the box that they grew up in. And then come those who can manipulate these people with a single line.

"This post is going viral to defend the government in not preparing us for the CoVID-19 situation. I thought I will respond to that with some facts.  Have you posted this on Facebook? I want to share this Great work on the replies and the links! I would suggest adding more, and as many as possible (we can help!) so this becomes a sort of mega post with sources that we can share with whoever encourages stupidity and blind worship of the govt. I see that the original article has no links or sources where as you provided sources. That's what these people do they rely on their flimsy opinion as whatsapp needs no sources but to prove them even to people that don't support them they need sources. Anyway great work. The fuck the target post reads like my 6th standard school essay. What shitty level of sycophantic behaviour is this. Isn't this the same article that was posted on rediff ? Who even believes this is written by someone who is not a BJP supporter? I don't even bother getting into an argument with people who post these (which rather sadly was done by atleast 5 people on my timeline who went to premier institutions in the country - all were priveleged upper class Hindus even before I met them during my post grad). I feel like it's impossible to change someone who is well read and still blindly supports everything the government does. The chance that they will turn on BJP at some point of time is the same as me voting for BJP anytime in the future. I wasn't a big fan of Modi (2002 riots) but was hopeful of a sea change in India's development and corruption with the majority they had. 5 years of Modi has all but buried that hope forever. In a country of 1.3 billion people it's a miracle we have a PM that an overwhelming majority would listen to and I would love to be proved wrong about him by the way he leads us through this crisis. Our economy is going to take a while to recover with the US economy already crashing but if we come out of this with competitively less human casualty I would he appreciative of Modi for doing so This is my take from it.

March 2020: Hoard groceries to ensure survival

April 2020: Hoard electricity by charging all batteries to ensure survival

Never in my life have I seen availability of basic necessities be attacked at the whims of a megalomaniac who refuses to consult experts for the sake of the theatrics of a national level shock. Man, the stupidity of this government has no bounds. All state electricity board workers are mandated to work this weekend and I believe similar case in all the power plants and distribution companies. This is just to prepare for this potential issue. All for practically fucking nothing.

Creating unnecessary problems seem to be the mantra of this government. Any self respecting person would have walked back on this idea once this possibility of massive blackout scenario was explained. 

But egos of people involved in this government is so huge that they will take the risk of causing blackouts in this trying time instead of canceling this or ask people to just light lamps instead of turning off the lights. Yeah everyone please spread this and ask people to use their brain and only switch off the lights. If the grid falls the remember this is summer season and people still have to sleep. I had already out my power bank for charging this morning. Hopefully there isn't anything serious tomorrow The whole grid can fail for a week.Charged laptops will be the least of your concerns if that happens... Good tip. Ramp up the powerbank. Get candles (not to take part in Modi's jumla but to survive in darkness), batteries and mosquito coils. Prep to survive 12-24 hrs in total darkness. [deleted] All this stuff about how our grid can't handle all this  load shedding makes me want to switch off my main lines for half an hour just to be safe because I have seen the results of  excess electricity surges. (My PSU got fried as did my fridge that was switched off but plugged in). So even as a Modi nonsupporter I'll be forced to go further than bhakts for this chutiyap stunt.  I'll not be wasting my mobile flashlight though because I might need all the power in case of extended power breakdown.

"Government response to COVID-19  Please explain:
If the govt was aware of PPE shortages, why was 2 flights of PPE exported? It was against WHO advisory.

Why was a new fund setup and why is it not under RTI?

How is criticism immature, its the backbone of democracy. Also how did clapping in the streets show appreciation for the HCW who are at risk.

How does lighting candles promote unity. The govt is asking frustrated masses stuck at home, to be part of a ritual, instead of providing a proper plan. Its, for a lack of a better word jhumla. Thanks for putting out all these facts (and hence provide us with the point of view of the government more clearly) 

Although i still believe that when the PM of the largest democracy addresses his nation, he should take sufficient steps to clear the fizz around lack of masks, ventilators, gloves, low testing, food reserves, wages and salaries, migration problems and so on instead of asking everyone to clap or light candles...

The show hooks you from the very first episode. I've never seen anything like it before. Better than Breaking Bad and GoT easily. Movies:

1. Last week saw a Spanish movie called Platform. Blew me away. Amazing directing, editing and hard hitting storyline. 

2. Knives Out - Gotta watch it. It's more like Murder on Orient Express, but a really good egg. 

3. 1917 - Wasn't really impressed, could be just because I really didn't like it much. 

Documentary: 

1. The Least Expected Day (Spanish) - It's on a cycling team called Movistar - Just in awe of the effort, the determination, these guys have + the team dynamics + individual interests, how everything sits together. 

2. Chernobyl (2 time watch) - No words to explain except: ""When the truth offends, we lie and lie, until we can no longer remember it is ever there. But it is still there. Every lie we tell incurs a debt to the truth. Sooner or later, that debt is paid."" Tv shows-
1. The OA - If you're into sci-fi, here's a totally unique concept of NDE & timelines. Dark fans would love it. (cancelled after season 2 by Netflix)
2. The Good Place- created by Michael Schur. 
3. The Sopranos - oh man. I'm on season 4 and i just can't stop watching it. The role of Tony Soprano(the lead character, an Italian gangster) was the inspiration for creating iconic TV characters like Walter white from Breaking Bad & Don Draper from Mad men. The mood, the scenes, the tension, not brainer The Sopranos was voted No. 1 tv show to watch by almost all sites & magazines. Could this be stickied?

"[AskIndia]How did China prevent the virus spreading to other states but allowed it to spread across India ?  1. They cant and didnt  
You can't 'control' life. It finds a way...      
2. Treating symptoms, drug combo's and experience from previous outbreaks. They were already in a better prepared scenario and was able to scale up infrastructure in a couple of weeks/along with early internal lockdown.  
Italy didn't take adequate precautions, has a higher older age population and was late to respond. The worst is over for italy now. US and possibly Brazil could top charts next if not us.       
3. Possible many countries are doing atm. Mortality rates in countries which took adequate precautions and had better responsive/emergency measures have low mortality rates along with greater testing. China hid the numbers, and the peak started to develop during a human mass migration event. This allowed the virus to start spreading everywhere. The Chinese government, if it did not hide the spread of the virus, would have stopped travel way before CNY migration started. The spread in India came through International travel. * Dictatorship does as dictatorship wishes. The Chinese media whose only source is the government said that it didn't, doesn't mean it didn't. 

* Italy has a very high population of senior citizens and unluckily they had to be left untreated to save the younger population.

* If not millions, at least a lakh did. 

JSR 1. Cuz the virus didn't ask for China's permission before spreading across India. It controlled it internally the same way India is trying to - by enforcing lockdowns. 

2. This is a slightly technical question. Better to ask it on r/covid19 if you want good answers.

3. Yes, it is possible. No one outside the Chinese govt will ever know the truth. 1. It spread through whole of China before it spread to India or anywhere else
2. Mortality is in reality about 10% or more in China (Italy's health care system is way better than China's)
3. Millions died in China

I see your ‘Non-political’ tag, but honestly you cannot change the fundamentals without tasting the “sweet” Indian Politics. Hindu-Muslim itself is a very controversial political topic.

No, India cannot change immediately after this Covid-19. The roads will have traffic jams again. The air pollution level will increase back to being worse. You’ll have the noise pollution again. Rash driving, spitting, littering, etc. 
People who are complacent don’t want change. People who are corrupt, don’t want change. People who have power, don’t want change. As long as people like Sadhvi, Yoginath, etc. are there to influence the mob, don’t expect a big reform. You can bring in all the autonomous trucks you want you’ll find them burnt down amidst a Hindu-Muslim riot one day. You wanna clean your house? Kill the cockroaches too. 

Yes, India will change eventually. India will change because of the newer upcoming generations. And, India can change if we are able to successfully educate the people. If we can make them understand their right to education. And, if they cannot access the resources, then we take the resources to them. India will change when the people (or generation) currently ruling the country dies, and a new generation takes over.

Now most countries in South East Asia are struggling to trace their citizens who were at that rally and the people they came into contact with. A few days ago Bangladesh saw a similar prayer gathering of thousands of people so we can expect a cluster there in a couple of weeks. 

So all you need is ONE guy to be infected in that crowd at the bus station and we could potentially see thousands or even tens of thousands of infections originate from this. This is going to be compounded by the fact they are all bound for different parts of rural India. The poor healthcare infrastructure in rural India will be completely overwhelmed by this which means thousands of unnecessary deaths because hospitals don't have enough beds or ventilators to cope with the surge in patients.

"The real loser in India's errupting Islamaphobia: Caste politics.  I understand everything you say except 

> But the fact remains that Modi's government has done spectacular work for the backward communities (barring muslims). We in urban areas scoff at the Modi governments but their work for the financially weak and socially disadvantaged has been phenomenal. From being called ""Congress + Cow"" it has been jokingly called ""Prakash Karat + Cow"". Such is the success of Modi's socialist policies that I have to begrudgingly accept it as the unequivocal truth.

What exactly are these policies? Real problem is fake news. Most people aren't smart enough to check facts by themselves. I think for a long time in this country, there was a belief that the 15% Muslims have a veto on who rules India in BJP circles. I think there is a quote by Balbir Punj, former BJP MP saying the same. 

The thing is that although as you say 85% of Indian Muslims are backward classes, the whole community itself was almost a single monolith when it came to voting preferences. 

Coming to some specific parties, say Mulayam Singh. As the family becomes powerful, it looses focus and becomes a Yadav party and all other OBCs leave. Same for Mayawati. As she becomes all powerful, Jatavs become powerful. All others leave. 

BJP, has in fact given tickets to the non Yadav OBCs and non Jatav Dalits in a significant number. What BJP has done at the same time is create the most loyal caste base India has seen: Upper caste Hindus. They will vote BJP because they are scared of everyone else. 

The opposition is not without blame for this. When you constantly 24/7 call BJP a Hindu party screaming at the top of your lungs, you are literally begging the Hindus to vote BJP.

Conclusion: I don’t think the caste politics is dying. It’s just that it’s been played in a different way which seems more efficient. 

P.S.  this is just a discussion. Do not take anything too seriously I don't agree with the ""government uplifting backward classes and hence getting the votes"" part. Most of the policies, as already mentioned by others, predate this government. Furthermore, most of them are either pure disaster(DeMo), mismanaged policies with potential(GST), or did very little compared to how hyped up they were(swaccha bharat, ujjawala). MNREGA, beti bachao beti padao and the likes existed even in UPA era, and were better funded than now.

Poverty literally increased under modi, so did unemployment, and income inequality. I should remind you that UPA under Manmohan uplifted record number of people after poverty in a decade, a record only second to china, farmers too, which constitute most of the backward people in India did far better under Manmohan. 

What's getting them vote is organised hatred they spread online. Indian people are gullible, and BJP were quick to capitalise on that. People don't question the policies because they don't see the government as the problem, the media and the IT cell have given people other enemies to blame in trying times- Muslims, Congress and Pakistan. 

I should add, if you think upper castes think any better of the backward ones now, you're wrong. Nobody's enlightened, they just have a bigger enemy for now.  If hypothetically, muslims were removed, the caste system will reach it's former glory in no time. Pleasantly surprised to see a post like this identifying that a majority of Muslims are indeed erstwhile so called lower caste pedigree. 

Goes to strengthen my view that there aren’t really religions in India but castes, castes and castes. 

That out of the way, the lower castes are - by design - kept under educated and under represented that very few realise they’re being used. Example: https://www.telegraphindia.com/culture/books/book-review-i-could-not-be-hindu-the-story-of-a-dalit-in-the-rss-by-bhanwar-meghwanshi/cid/1765671

In Karnataka, for example, many towns have a colony called a “A K colony”. The A K denotes a caste and as opposed to an “agrahaara” which are usually a Brahmin stronghold, the AK colonies are typically a stronghold of a particular low caste often reflecting the gross neglect over time as well. 

These places - and others like it - have always had high unemployment. All of this is a complete package you know. It’s extremely hard to get out of. Anyway, in these places the testosterone fuelled unemployed youth are usually up to no good. Given no support system and discrimination outside and all. Back then they were used by the powerful as henchmen or for other dirty work. Now they’re still used by the powerful but the new powerful are all consolidating under the Hindutva label. 

The caste system is so uniquely ubiquitous in everyday life that the privileged bubble inhabitants can’t even begin to fathom the “world building” that invoked if it all were presented as a novel.

There are some unique castes - typically the erstwhile landowner class. Who’ve since graduated to owning large institutions, businesses and so on. You know, grown up, productive stuff. I have so much awe for how they look after their own and the sort of support system they’ve developed for themselves which allows even for the “underperformer” amongst them to achieve something in life that he or she may feel proud of.

This almost never happens in the case of a lower caste disadvantaged person. The rare ones who do happen to break out of it - if they were lucky enough to get some sort of support in the form of reservations _and_ familial, financial support and have the fortitude to survive the education system without being discriminated against. They still face an uphill struggle wherever they end up working at. More so if it’s a government workplace. 

If they excel and do better than their peers they’re subject to allegations of having cheated and get corruption cases filed against them. And after having to face all of this shit in their career are left with little to no wherewithal to be what they wish they had when they were young - a mentor, godfather or a role model to their own “kind”. Just like in the other powerful castes, ahem, “communities”. 

And that’s where the current _shaaka_s are capitalising on. Catching them young. Keeping them dumb. Not letting them rise. Making them hate each other and the Muslims who’re no different than they are. Driving away the “missionaries” who come with an education package. 

A core feature of a hierarchy is that it is designed to always make anyone who’s not at the very top nor at the very bottom to have someone to feel superior to. And those at the lower ladders are at a double whammy position where they’re not enlightened enough to realise the harm they’re doing unto themselves by being part of some of the heinous crimes you hear of in places like TN.

Anyway, it’s a shit show. I’m envious that a majority of the caste denying elitists here don’t have to see or imagine any of this and live their grand privileged lives envying that one SC guy who drove a BMW. 

No political party every stands for them. KA has had exceptional leaders from such castes for decades and they’re _never_ allowed to rise up. It’s by design. Nobody can break out of it. Your analysis is quite correct , and the reason Islamophobia is growing because many lower caste ar getting educated and thanks to propaganda they are likely to see Islam more of a threat compared to Brahminism.

 A small example of how Manusmriti ideology has even engulfed Dalits.

I happened to meet One of my batchmate who used to be a torched bearer of Ambedkarism in our university ( we both are Dalits).
I was shocked to see idols of gods and the blatant karmkand things in his house which he used to vehemently oppose.

I just asked him that what happened to you in all this year's .

His reply was ' Ye Buddhism Jai bhim wagerah mein maaza nahi hain , kya milta hai Buddhist banke ,enjoyement apne hindu religion mein hi hain, I got so many things when I started following hindu religion. Jai bhim banenege toh koi bhi festival nahi hain. ,Kya matlab uska.

I just told him that your job, degree is only because several decades back a man fought for it with the establishment ,if not for him you would be  sewering in a gutter and doing what you are supposed to do.

Many backward castes which have become affluent due to capitalism post 1990s are more hindus and more casteist than the Brahmins , like Yadav's , Gujjars, Marathas who are more indulged in caste based atrocities compared to the Brahmins . I think you make valid points regarding (a) why BJP has gained the reserved seats; and (b) caste politics has been overshadowed by the unifying hatred against the Muslims.

We all probably agree with u/Android5511 that the reason for (b) is not so much the effective implementation of welfare schemes but the successful deployment of polarising techniques by BJP and its media cohorts. That said I find their optimism that Modi-lahar might wane slightly misplaced for three reasons: (i) there is no indication that these polarising techniques have lost their efficiency; (ii) as the present pandemic has given the Center sweeping powers, regular administrative functions and even botched operations are now going to be touted as Modi's achievements; and (iii) the voting behaviour in state elections can be the opposite in central elections, case in point Jharkhand which they refer to.

Another shortcoming which I find in the print commentariat as they try to understand why Dalits vote for BJP is the shallowness of their analyses. Best exemplified by Dilip Mondal's article that you linked, they fail to answer why is it that Dalit voters, especially in urban areas, don't rally behind radical Dalit leaders. It would require a much lengthier write-up, but I suspect that it is the lure of savarna ethic and the success of capitalism which they are led into believing, owing to the constant media propaganda and the ineptitude of parliamentary Left in India. Please note that I am not saying the savarna ethic is worth emulating or that capitalism is actually successful, quite the opposite I would say. But such is the hegemonising power that the cultural elite have, a point noted by Gramsci and successive others.

The savarna ethic is a self-replicating one, a virus. One can see that many OBCs and many Dalits become strident defenders of Brahmanism once they acquire a certain degree of social mobility. Led into thinking that their emancipation is because of the savarna ethic, and not despite of it, many try to abnegate their Dalit identity itself. The same can be said about capitalism; it is the lure of this heady cocktail of Baniya capitalism that fuels India and shapes Dalit politics (outside the safe spaces of universities) today.

"Are people(especially men) really okay with with their partner's past history(boyfriends, sexual)? or are they just afraid of being labelled backward/prudish, or just want to fit in(with liberals/pseudo-liberals)?  You are almost 30 years old, which is probably more than 1/3 of your life. Expecting someone to be waiting more than 1/3rd of their life for their future partner is a little absurd imo. There is nothing wrong in that, its just a slim possibility. Also, there is some amount of gatekeeping hypocrisy there. In these kind of prudish thoughts, its always the female who has to remain 'pure' or 'sanskari'. And if you think of it, terms like 'honry', 'dirty' will make way to pious usages like 'love making' for describing sex once marriage is done.

Personally, my future partner's past won't affect me as long as it won't cause any problem with our future. I also think its sweet to share first intimacy with someone special to each other. Anyway, once you are in love, there is no place for past but a future to be together. Here it goes. 

1. Men who have sex are not pigs. Sex isn't dirty, it's just sex. There's no meaning to it as such, other than what someone gives to it. 

2. Sex is not correlated with honour. Looking at women as honourable just because she's never had sex is making them an object and passing judgement to their character based on what your male fantasy would want to think. 

3. Sex is fun. It's nice. It feels good. There you go. Girls get horny too, you know. It's not just you who's been jerking off thrice a day for the past 17 years. 

4. What bullshit is this partners first and last ? Are y'll objects and properties owning each other ? Sex is just sex, it's fun it's nice. You can compare it to watching movies. The only moral judgement you can pass on it is the morality you attach to sex itself. 

And this is personal (you can read up the sexist origins of monogamy) but in my life I've been privileged enough to meet some girls I've been able to love. There's no legitimacy to the idea that everyone has one person for them. People do exist polygamous relationships. Sex is just sex. There's nothing more to it, character, this, that. Nothing. 

5. Why does it mean so much to you ? Maybe you've spent your entire life fetishizing sex, but that's not what everyone does. More than, how can you hold someone else responsible for something they did before they even knew you ? Why does your morality have to be overriding ? 

Don't blame others for the image of life you've created in your own head. 



Do try to answer this, why are you fine with first base and not with Sex ? I'll tell you why, cause male thought and society teaches us unconsciously that a woman's value lies in her vagina. If it was her dignity and honour which lied in her body, even someone touching her would be an issue. Why this ?!


If there was some logic to this, you should be more offended by a long term relationship with a guy which will haunt you in the future than some random one night stand with a guy who's name the girl won't even remember. Is this still a thing? I did my college in early 2000s and we were mostly traditional bunch of girls then(aunties now). Those who remained virgins till marriage were so due to lack of opportunity, definitely not due to lack of interest or boyfriends. So yeah, even now, you can find such girls who had no opportunity, just find some girl from a small town or village who has always stayed with parents or better in a joint family. lmao what the fuck is this post I am not relationship expert but you have mentioned some generalization / stereotypes in your long query.

1. Not all men are pigs and just looking for sex. Even most is generalization.

2. Sex is not at all associated with honour.

3. Sex is subjective and depend upon the individual. For some it is casual and physical. For some it is emotional.

4. Nobody indulge in sex just for peer validation.

5.  You are not the only one who thinks like that. If you prefer your partner virgin then nothing is wrong with that. But demonize someone who is not virgin is wrong.

6. If previous relationship doesn't bother the current relationship then it shouldn't be a cause of worry. And i am personally fine with that. If you haven't had any relationships, it's perfectly fine to want someone who also hasn't.

I'll be downvoted here, but as long as you're not a hypocrite, you're allowed to have your preferences.

\>When asked if I can at least ask the girl upfront

I don't know if this will work, but you can just tell her that you don't have any past experience and would prefer someone who also doesn't. If she has any decency, she will make up some excuse to back out of the rishta even if she doesn't want to reveal anything.

Also, from what I've heard from friends, 99% of them will lie and pretend they didn't even if they did have bfs. I think being *very open minded* but a *certain extent* is a classic Indian trope. Fear of society labelling you conservative has led to the invention of such labels. It’s funny. Sounds like an oxymoron. 

Anyway, as to your question. Having a past isn’t a deal breaker. You had relationships. It doesn’t make a difference. What matters is what is the current situation. Are they still in relationship being forced by their parents? Maybe they are emotionally involved but not acting on it. Blah blah. These things matter more than sexual past. 

And honestly, look for a person you’re compatible with. 

Society seems to have trained us to believe virginity = virtue/honor. But it is not so. A girl’s honor is not in her pants. We all need to understand that. 

If you like the girl and respect her as an individual and she does the same to you, that should be the basis of a relationship. People have preferences, you have one. If you are not a hypocrite, it's fine. 

Don't ask her on the first meeting. Maybe on the 2nd or 3rd meeting when she's comfortable with you. 

Tell her about your past and how you would want someone who shares the same thoughts. She'll reject you if she's had some partners. I had similar thoughts. I was 29 then. Virgin, never had a relationship, introvert, nerd, from Govt school in a Tier 2 town, not much English skills and an average looking guy. After I got settled with a good job my parents introduced me to a girl from a metro, our both families met, i spoke with the girl, I told her all about me and asked if she had any relationships before, she said she never had any. she is well educated, working in an MNC , well bought-up, she spoke well, humble smart. We got engaged and then wedding and after a week I looked at her chats and email exchanges, extreme private stuff, sex, i was completely shocked, these were very old like 8 years or so. I didnt care much at first. but I asked her anyway about her past and she denied again. I didnt tell her I saw her emails though.  


Fastforward a couple of weeks, I further looked into all her accounts, emails, google chats, old FB chats and I learned, she had like 4-5 relationships in the past 8 years, casual sex, relationships were so casual like she was with a guy for like just 2 months. I had no ill feelings for her but atleast she could have told me about all this before things went ahead with us. I confronted her with all this and she told she was afraid that her parents might come to know about her. Things went only south from here. Because she was still regularly speaking with a couple of guys. but only ""friendly"" she claimed.  


I still trusted her but things did not end good for us. I could not go ahead with the marriage and wanted to come out of it. But she is smart. It has been few years now and yet life never returned to normal. A part of me hates me for being not so smart enough to see through things early, for not handling things better and making my life a mess. I still cannot think why men/women hide things about their relationships from their husband/Wife? I believe good or bad, it is always better to come clean before marriage. Sooner or later truth eventually will come out and it is not going to end well if you hide your past. It will destroy everyone's lives. OP more concerned if you can see the number 90 on your keyboard than being a virgin at 30. So many parentheses those 2 numbers are faded out, no? Why does it bother you?

"I'm scared what's going to happen to India in the future  Every now and then, I too get flustered and my anxiety kicks in when I think too much about the current state of our country. The thing is, Indians are very unpredictable because this country works more on emotion than on logic. The tables have turned overnight in the past or it took 200yrs sometimes. 

But I do have a solution to calm your self and be at peace again. And that solution is the one quote I always make sure to read and remember.

“When I despair, I remember that all through history the way of truth and love have always won. There have been tyrants and murderers, and for a time, they can seem invincible, but in the end, they always fall. Think of it--always.” - M. K. Gandhi Have you lit lamp yesterday?

Go Corona Go Simple solution: emigrate. This country is beyond help. The lighting of lamps and the clanging if utensils were a show of power by Modi. It was a warning to anyone who questions him or his party, he was showing off how much control he has over the majority of the population and how much weight his words carried amongst his followers. All its going to take is a pre recorded 5 minute speech to wipe out his opposition. No.. Indian sheeple will never have a revolution.. Don't think they will even vote different, partly out of fear and partly because they are easily manipulated by religion... So nothing will happen, don't worry. Of course, if you are end up on the 'wrong' side, prepare for some inconveniences - could be sorted by money, not standing out, having escape routes etc. If you are a conscientious lot, and feel that all this is wrong, just take a deep breath and accept it. Accept the worst case, maybe we see genocide in our time or unimaginable things. Nothing else to be done now - my anxiety is not going to affect anything except my ability to be prepared. Depressing thoughts, but this attitude helps me cope now. No revolution is coming, our people is too servile for that. If you are a genuine Indian brought up in Independent India, that should be your thoughts now, unless....unless.. you are corrupted by saffron poison. 

If you drunk saffron poison, it’s difficult to ingest good thoughts into you. Saffron Poison drinker will not go alone, but he takes the entire community he belongs to, they destroys whatever comes across their path. That’s the power of saffron poison. 

Indians should wake up and spread anecdotes for the saffron poison, and eradicate the saffron poison and its creators and its benefactors altogether. The Roman empire, the French empire, the British empire, the Turkish empire all have turned to ash. Only their figments remain on earth to cast memories in minds of the people that anything built will eventually meet the dust. Only ideas and ideologies remain while flesh fades away. Anything build on sheer power, on trickery, on oppression and on greed will crumble-ash to ash, dust to dust- and eventually this regime set upon on these gruesome qualities will fall either by people or by time..... Honestly this feels more like the 3rd Reich than the French Revolution. We've already got the SA(not SS),the so called RSS. We're waiting for the night of the long Knives. And yes there were people,german people who protested to save jews,they were also killed. You can see the similarity here. only difference is that Hitler was named best leader by forbes for uplifting Germany from poverty and conducting massive industralization reforms,not which our counterpart is famed for. I really think India will have it's French revolution sooner or later. Because it's only going to get worse and worse. 
Someone somewhere is going to snap and that'll be the start. Your understanding of french revolution seems incomplete.. there has been no large scale debt hiding to start with. No one is thinking we are a super power and invincible... also, regime change happens every now and then in india.... also, democracy is functioning fine..",Non-Political
"These Corona virus events are not the best way to judge Modi’s popularity. Hear me out.  I agree most part  but -


death of independent media was because of Modi sending Income tax notices and withdrawal of revenue generating ads from govt.


Communalisation of this pandemic is due to government intentionally turning a blind eye to such reporting. What tablisi gang did is unforgiving but the communalisation  of the same can't be justified.

"Thoughts on police violence during lock down  There is a difference between Curfew and a Lockdown. This a Lockdown. Here important stuffs are ***ALLOWED***. Like food items, like veggies, milk, eggs, etc. And it's specifically mentioned by the Prime Minister himself.



Yes, Indians might hate following rules but that doesn't give anyone the right to be violent. A young father died because he went to buy milk, fruit sellers carts destroyed. That is no way to impose anything. Take them, lock'em up. Fine 'em. But beating? Why? This is not justice. This is fear. I have seen far more cases of police brutality than of police actually helping people, there's a reason only 25% of people trust the police in india [removed] There are clear instructions  to allow home delivery of essential supplies . Allow  Journalists and others who are listed under essential services . They ignore them and just beat every one who is on the roads ,

They are humans too , but they are trained professionals.  

Some people  who read the Instructions ,felt safe and went out to get veggies, milk and groceries are also beaten . 

After 2 days they realize the mistake and now issuing the passes to vendors. 

In Hyderabad , they ordered to shutdown hostels,which led to the exodus of non locals to their hometowns.  As all the state borders are sealed , they are  struck on roads. Then they ordered the hostels to stay open . With all the other facilities restricted , how will they run hostels like they used to before. 

Day 1 and 2 are  disaster . They simply paralyzed he society with  their  actions . The call is for lockdown  to enable social distancing.

No one survives 21 days with out  supplies. In India , there are many families  who buy groceries on daily basis . 

There are joy riders and Jay walker in punished but that wont justify the blanket ban on stepping outside. If the police is indiscriminately using force on people clearly  delivering essential goods forget innocent people trying to get those essential goods, then should they just be let off the hook?

The countries that are winning against coronavirus, have implemented only partial lockdown. The only thing they have done is that they tested, tested, tested,tested and tested. The virus won't disappear after 21 days, it will be back. The only thing 21 days does is that it buys time for the government to buy testing kits, PPE's and ventilators (if it can).

1. Rs. 20-000 allocated for Parliament house when we are in this mess.
2. The doctors and nurses don't have gloves and masks in government hospitals and they are being threatened to treat people.
3. The Police can't do shit until they get orders from Central or state government, They are beating people when they were transporting essentials, Service providers were forced to dump 15000 liters of milk and 10,000 kg of Vegetables, the supply was being delivered to New Delhi. Why? Delhi is under Kejriwal
4. Yogi assured door to door delivery in U.P. I can assure you it won't reach Muslims.
5. Why the free test is not available for all? 4500 in this crucial times is a lot, How will a middle-class family of 4 arrange 18k for the tests?
6. 18 companies could prepare it AT a lower price of 500rs but a Gujrat based company was approved, Now because of this high price, people will avoid these tests and more people will get affected.
7. While this thing is going on, Some big scam will take place and we won't even notice it.
8. The whole economic mess they have created in the past 6 years, they will blame everything on COVID-19
9. Something very fishy is going on, He should have mentioned the lockdown hours before 8 pm, No fucking time can be selected when the lives of crores are at stake, It should have been done immediately the meeting was over.
10. They are whitewashing the walls of Jamia between all this mess, those walls has Anti-Caa graffiti. Modi had no intention of fucking up the economy with demonitisation, but he did.

Nobody's doubting the government has good intentions, but it's the lack of planning and inability to anticipate consequences that is frustrating. The police just can't muscle through this lockdown and force people to stay at home without addressing their need for basic essential goods, it just won't work it will make matters far worse.

This 21 day lockdown is our only hope to fight against the pandemic, our Healthcare system isn't advanced enough and it's infrastructure can't handle the situation if the cases cross 30000. This is our only fight and we have to do it properly and effectively. There has to be a solid plan which should be implemented throughout the country.

Having a 2 hour window period everyday for people to buy groceries is a perfect example for a stupid plan. It will force people to come out in hoards to buy supplies which defeats the whole purpose of quarantine. Also scaring people to sit at home and starve won't work for long, eventually hunger will overcome fear and there will be riots.

Don't for a minute think that it's just 21 days and after that everything will be back to normal because it's very much likely that we are going to be locked down for way more than 21 days. The government has to make this lockdown work and beating up people is just not the way to do it. There's no point calling out the government about what it should have done couple of months ago. There's no excuse for their incompetence then. That ship has sailed. I just hope, from now onwards it does not fuck up.

"Describing bhakts as people having 'tilak' is offensive to non-bhakt hindus. Please stop it.  Similarly, every person who wears a skull cap =/= a terrorist. Unfortunately, if people like you don't start standing up and discrediting the *bhakts*, prepare to face the same fate of being branded like the muslims in the times to come. >people will start assuming all who put a tilak are f\*\*king bhakts.

I admit I do this in my mind. I don't assume they're bhakts, but I am wary - more of a ""be careful what you say to or in front of this guy about religion or politicians"" thing. Not because of comics but because a lot of hindutva leaders and vigilantes on TV and videos use such prominent decorations. 

I'm not sure what a simple solution is though. If there are some ""good"" hindu religious organizations, then I think they should demand hindutva not use hindu religious symbols. How about... all the good tilaks come together and tell the bad tilaks to stop being bad tilaks Wouldn't it be wiser to ask the bhakts to not spoil the meaning of Tilak or bringing shame to Tilak. As long as bhakts proudly display such symbols and do malicious things, it is but natural that those symbols become the symbols of malicious things. We can't do much about it. Bhakts=Hindus is mostly true and Hindus being bhakts not. I dont think in real life anyone cares Lol you are not triggered by the violence they do in the name of Hindus, but you are more triggered by the cartoonists. If bhakts starts killing people by using trishul, will you ask people to not say anything about the weapon as it is related to lord Shiva. No, because the fault is of those goons who are using these religious items for their dirty work. Well it's how propoganda starts isn't it. You need to make a visible villan..when trying to rouse a group against another you ought to make generalised statements...all namaz reading people are terrorists ..all tilak wearing Hanuman chalisa reading people are bhakts..it's easy to say because real problems are complex because people are complex. No one wants to agree to that when angry 😂 Non bhakt Hindus  complaining  about cosmetics are bystanders. Worse than Bhakts. All who wear tilak may not be Hindu terrorists, but almost all Hindu terrorists wear a tilak, saffron clothes. Hence, all people wearing tilak are potentially Hindu terrorists. 
>This is not cool.

Maybe you ought to have said that to the bhakts who've been co-opting your symbols for decades.

*  never concede that there may be some good in your enemy; 
* never leave room for alternatives; 
* never accept blame;  
* concentrate on one enemy at a time and blame him for everything that  goes wrong (Congress and Nehru in this case)
* people will believe a big lie sooner than a little one, and if you repeat it frequently enough people will sooner or later believe it.

"With Delhi exit polls out, it seems Congress has permanently lost one more state, making it difficult to win any future general elections. Today Congress is incapable of winning 243 / 543 Lok sabha seats even before the elections begin [analysis inside]  Given that Congress has no chance of winning in Delhi anyway, they would prefer AAP winning rather than BJP. AAP winning Delhi means BJP will start looking more vulnerable given its recent losing streak in state elections. If Congress had tried to campaign for the Delhi elections in earnest, they still wouldn't come even close to winning, all they would do is steal a few voters from AAP (since AAP and Congress voter-base overlap), making AAP's win less likely. So the better strategy is to remain in the sidelines. [removed] The United States in its 243 years of history has not had more than 2 Presidents from the same family. India, a toddler at 71 years, has had 3 Prime Ministers from the same family already. And, INC wants us to give us their fourth. Is that even a democracy anymore? 

Many don't really hate Rahul Gandhi as an individual, at least I don't, but I'd never vote for him if he's the PM candidate. In fact, I'd actually prefer another blue eyed boy of INC, yet another dynast, Sachin Pilot over him. Also, Sachin Pilot is a smart guy too :) I usually do not comment here, but my opinion is one held my Indians. 

The Congress (at the center) has become indistinguishable from a Family party. They have systematically eliminated or sidelined any promising leader coming through their rungs as they would be a threat to the Gandhis.                           
Today, all that remains is a politically foolish idiot at the helm, and a bunch of intelligent but neutered members hat are rendered powerless by this structure. The congress lost a historic loss in 2019. Rahul Gandhi's career should have been dead in the water. But, he continues being the only ""leader"" congress can have.        

I consider myself a left-leaning liberal and am an atheist. Even then, I refuse to vote for a congress party that continues to worship the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty.

I do not like the BJP either, but a competent left leaning party in India would have gotten my vote. 

____________

Lastly, this sub needs a reality check.

If you think Modi won a historic win in 2020 purely because every one of those voters was a muslim-hating bhakt, then all hope is lost for the left in India.                                    

Modi and Shah, as much as I hate their ideology, have been extremely astute in navigating the political landscape of India.                
Secondly, a lot of the ""reforms"" implemented by them have been previously suggested by the Congress itself. In many ways, it is quite left-leaning in terms of economic policy.                    

Beating your enemy, first needs you to understand why your enemy succeeded, and that requires a bit of humility and respect. You may hate the tiger for eating your child, but to beat it, you have to first learn to respect its abilities as a predator. As yogendra Yadav said, Congress is stuck in limbo. It is still strong enough to be the largest opposition party but not strong enough to defeat BJP. It is in a limbo state where no other opposition party is able to emerge It's UPA that needs to win.

Why are you coming up with this analysis is beyond me.

Congress never got 243 seats in 2004 and 2009.

So your analysis is factually incorrect.


Congress just needs a strong alliance with TMC,SP,BSP,DMK,TDP,JMM, Shiv Sena etc. Remove Gandhis To be honest both BJP and Congress didn't fight this election at all. They just gave in for a bigger picture. Both are quite comfortable for making AAP do all the work and let BJP focus on polarizing and fucking people's mind all over India with their propoganda and Hindutva politics. It is just a platform for them. Sure this won't work in Delhi, but it surely will in UP and Bihar and Karnataka. BJP never cared for Delhi since they have Police and Administration under them. What else they need to rule? So Kejriwal is a winner for sure, but Modi is a bigger winner by spewing hate and division message via Shaheen Bagh to the rest of the country, and us plebians will think Kejriwal win is a hope for India. No it is not. Modi himself prefers Kejriwal over Congress. Anything for Congress mukt Bharat so the secular front gets removed completely. Congress + National Conference in J&K

Congress alone in Punjab, Himachal, Uttarakhand, Haryana, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Chattisgarh

Congress + SP in UP

Congress + JDS in Karnataka

Congress + DMK in TN

Telengana, Andhra, Bengal and Kerala are the only states where Congress and other non BJP parties are in direct competition with one another, so alliances are a little difficult here but your analysis is way off in thinking that India doesn't have a opposition.

Indian opposition doesn't have any strategy to beat BJP right now but they are alive and well. They just need to get off their asses and fight. As long as Gandhis are at the helm, there's no hope for Congress. AAP only rules one terrority. Stop comparing it with Congress.

ThePrint certainly seems to do that. I agree. He doesn't sound too biased to the left or right. Doesn't use impassioned language. He's quite a cynic himself. That.helps.I guess. The CTC and National Interest series are very well made. I watched the video and in the end he said the content is going to be behind a paywall soon which is sad to hear. Maybe you should've added that to the original post so we can try to donate to it and maybe they will reconsider. Agree. He seems to sympathize with the waste of resources in Congress, otherwise, he has a lot of perspective. And his stories are my favorite!!",Politics
"Seeming paradoxes  If your support for a political party makes you ignore the truth then you're a bhakt. Doesn't matter which political party you support. Here is my take, I feel one cannot be a fence sitter because the inclination to a particular belief, judgement or ideology becomes important when we decide our choice and queue up to vote. This is the only time where we need to do our homework right. It is like saying I would feel comfortable with a corrupt party over an authoritarian party having tendencies of inciting genocide. Sadly these are some of the arguments that come to mind. I would still give the benefit of doubt to the non arm chair activists in many cases. It takes a lot to stand up to authority and especially the government/bureaucracy (any). I guess to make a choice ultimately we need to look at a party/group with filters that are non negotiable for us. This is so true man.I remember Kunal Kamra tweeting Kanhaiya is Marx of 21st century.I mean even if he is very Marx like what's the need to project him like a hero figure.Aren't we in this bullshit cuz of heroism.First Indira Gandhi now modi.When are people gonna learn that these politicians are never faithful to their ideology. You are making a false equivalence mate I don't define these groups as right or left. They are confusing terms for lay persons. Call them conservatives and liberals. Conservatives are, as the term denotes, wary of change, and prefer the old order. You pick any group, conservatives prefer the'good old days'. They are part of the 'old guard', and are unwilling to adapt to a rapidly changing world. 

Let's take India's example. We lived under the same patriarchal religious hierarchy till the British conquest, who introduced new ideologies, to which India adapted to in under 100 years. Most liberal countries went through multiple stages of evolution, from serfdom to monarchy to republic to democracy to republic, you get the idea. This conversion happened across hundreds of years, and through gradual change, we arrived at a moderate solution. 

Even then, the advent of faster communications caused a rift in all of humanity. Suddenly, there was an influx of vast information, new schools of thought and ideologies. People saw others who lived differently from us. For the West, it was the Orient, and for us, it was the occident. 

Have you noticed how it is always the younger generations that adapt to newer technology the fastest? A tabula rasa is easier to mould and more accepting of new ideas. Suddenly, the Brahmins and kshatriyas see the vaishyas and shudras asking for equal rights, for women demanding to have more freedom. For people who earlier were used to commanding people, found themselves at a sudden disadvantage. This led to fear, and an urge to protect their status quo. 

Political ideologies are but a facade for this fear, and there are extremists on all sides. There is no right wing or left wing in politics. It's just people who wish to protect their own power, and people who wish to usurp that power. TLDR: Be aware of the [fallacy of black-and-white thinking](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/anxiety-fear-and-hate/201903/black-and-white-thinking-in-hate). Completely agree with you, it is difficult finding Normies,sane 'non-bhakt' ppl at such times,other day,I saw ambedkarites and gandhiwadis fighting each other and abusing both personalities, and trying hard to prove one is greater than other,lol which is so contradictory to what both preached, ambedkar was against hero worship, and Gandhi was man of peace, but their followers seem to be on another level at times, 

that's why I keep telling myself,the fight is against issues, and concept of evils of society, not against any personality. Also,we have a huge cult problem, we are so gullible we just want some messiah to always step in,help us through, and we try finding that messiah in politicians,actors,godman, et.et, we need to sort out that ASAP! >There are a similar number of crass and bigoted people even in the anti-Modi camp.

kind of agree w this.. found many marathi bigots who vote for worse parties like shiv sena and claim to be liberal (rofl) just because they oppose BJP, congress supports grand temple in ayodhya, cpim arrested muslim activists just because they criticized their CM, mamta is as opportunist, she can't mix with the rest of the supposed 'liberal clan' against bjp because she has her own political motives. 

in fact, there exist no secular parties or secularism in true sense in India, it's always been hindutva or other extremes >While I am a Marxist and a socialist, I prefer not to be part of a group that cannot look into the eyes of truth.

I  am neither Marxist nor a socialist. But, I completely agree with your views.

When I did not like the corruption and arrogance of the Congress government (let's not forget the arrogance of Manish Tewari, Kapil Sibal, Abhishek Manu Singhvi etc.) and wanted them to lose, I was shocked by the amount of hatred and bigotry some of my friends supporting BJP had. This turned me off even before the 2014 elections.

Right now, I see seeds of something similar in the other side. I can not believe that people consider someone like Kanhaiya Kumar a hero and symbol of resistance to Hindutva. I can not believe that someone like that Kashmiri police officer being arrested suddenly is cold hard proof of Pulwama attack being a false flag operation. I have spent a lot of time as a college student laughing at 9/11 conspiracy nuts. Now, I get to meet 26/11 conspiracy-mongers.

There will always be some idiots, but, please don't let your heads get swayed by stupidity just because it suits you. Enemy or enemy is not always friend. It can sometimes be worse than the enemy. We learned it from giving power to Hindutva nuts. Let's not repeat our mistakes. Wow...that's some post...sensible observation. People these days want to categorize people in to groups. One is either Modi bhakt, Congress bhakt or kejri bhakt to them and they want to know which side they are so that they can either broaden their group or mark them as opposite group. I was a Modi supporter because I was fed up of Congress but now Modi/BJP is getting worse for democracy and this country.
One should not follow anyone blindly. Both BJP, Congress , AAP or every other party/people  have both the flaws and some good qualities. Try to have the story of both the sides (as I try to do now). Praise their good policies and raise questions over their bad policies. I approach what OP thinks from the other side.

I am generally supportive of Modi, but am disturbed by the trend of CAA and NRC.

I believe that Modi should forget about these distractions, repeal CAA and concentrate on governance and growth.",Politics
"What's the state of Intercaste marriages in India ?  Last I checked, some 3% of Indian marriages are love marriages. Which means the vast majority are arranged. 

Arranged marriages are almost always within the same caste Get independent and richer than your parents. Everybody listens to you then if you stand your ground. less than 5% of all marriages in India No chance. 

you have to marry with in your caste. you may get away with it if you are in love and parents agree. But you have to be really really lucky. 

For arranged marriage , no way intercaste is allowed in india. 

Although what i fail to understand is how does caste impact the person you are going to marry. I can understand religion to some extent. 

Things like education/job/personality/attitude may affect a relationship/marriage, but caste. I mean WTF. There's no state, only Goa. No matter how open some parents seem once marriage drops it only swings one way. There's also a surge in caste based matrimonial sites these days. SC/ST , please forgive . To those who oppose inter-caste relations, the cast does affect a marriage.

A lot of people are hell-bent on stereotyping people based on their caste, so they assume nature, loyalty and most things about a person based on their caste. 

A person's nature is a result of his family background and surroundings, and a few years back in most places communities were segregated based on caste, so a person's nature was a reflection of his caste.

This judgment continues now, even when people from all backgrounds are progressing.

It will take time but slowly as a result of interaction with all sorts of people, things will change.",AskIndia

"Discussion with a typical NRI  Ehhh ... Hedgewar, the founder of RSS, was a doctor and Golwalkar was a science graduate and that too about 100 years ago. So, education has nothing to do with common sense.

 If NRI bhakts  are in love with Pradhan sewak ji simply tell them to come to India and if they are PIO's take up Indian citizenship. Ask them if they would be ok if trump went full Modi and made them show citizenship by birth for every member of family they have (and not just the ones they deliberately gave birth to in US to get a green card). Or worse, if he decides to revoke the birthright citizenship (which he has been threatening to) and now they have no way to get that sweet sweet green card. [deleted] En NRI bhakhts ki hypocrisy koi seema nahi hoti.

You are living abroad as minority in another country. You also complain of facing discrimination but back home you support a guy who and his party promotes communal hatred and discrimination towards minorities.

Don't get wrong, it's fine to complain about the discrimination you might have experienced but it doesn't make sense and is very hypocritical when back home you literally support a guy and the party which promotes discrimination. I am an NRI, My jain and Gujarati  NRI friends are not so blatantly open, but speak things like he is cleaning the system etc, but in their heart they mean exactly what you just laid out. Nowadays they speak less but fully support the supreme leader. More importantly, they gang up on me as I am only one who does not support Modi(so you support Rahul is their answer). I am talking about folks who have done BE computer science, MS from US and are Directors and Sr. Directors in top technology companies.  There is something wrong with me or them as we see world very differently.  FYI, same guys supported Trump. Sadly, such illiberal narrow-minded people participate in their adopted countries' discourse too, and spread their illiberalism and narrow mindedness there too. First gen NRIs are hopeless cases I am NRI and not a supporter of modi. One of my NRI friends based in silicon valley, (damn I respect him so much), One of the smartest guy I have ever met in my life. He and his wife together have net worth of half a billion . ( they started from scratch, founders of unicorn based in CA). But they support pradhan sevak ji. I don't really talk about politics with them, but they definitely have a different view of bjp than I do.  They are deshasth brahmins. If anything, not harsh enough.

"The problem with the anti-CAA protests is the messaging adopted by the liberals and the leftists  I am with kejriwal on this one. NRC will disproportionately affect poor people. Our local bureaucracy will have a price for the required documents, and people with money will obtain it, regardless of relegion. This is what happened in Assam as well. The government has declared war on the poor and the working class of this country, and there is a good chance that both sides has not realised this yet. It's simple isssue 
The thing is there are systematically trying to make an electorate, that is suited to their political ambitions

They're trying to disenfranchise a lot of people, tribals poor and people who they think doesn't belong to India

It's a question of many things
Governmental inefficiency , corruption and misuse of power as any government officials can declare you stateless and say to furnish proof of your citizenship
It' would led to creating a system of continuous harassment for certain sections of the society Modi did not think twice screwing up the economy with demonetization for BJP own gains. . Demonitization was done solely so BJP would be the only party to have money to win UP elections. CAB /NRC is to mainly to get Bengal. And they will most likely succeed. They are focussed on their own goals. They don’t care if something is good for the populace or not. In their mind its good for the long term goal of Hindu rashtra that will secure the future and safety of Hindus with a Hindu homeland. They're so many flaws with the CAA and NRC itself. Although upfront a protest seems to be because of one reason. They're well aware of the drawbacks. That's the reason not just Muslims but Hindus too are protesting for the bill.
Also NRC here is suspected to be applied on everyone else except the Muslims. That's its sole purpose according to Mo-Shah's agenda. This whole process puts a lot of authority on local officials like say the district magistrate or some other political appointee even. Such a person can countersign and verify someone's claim that they have lived in the locality and that then becomes valid in the eye of the law. This being India the process needs to be smoothened with bribes as well. Or if the person in authority has orders from above that person can easily discriminate between religions with total impunity. People affected by them might not have the means to resort to legal procedures to right this wrong. The bhakts hope to be on the right side of the process as they very well might be in such a case.

In Assam families had to pay lakhs of money to get their names in the NRC list even if there was like a very small and quite common discrepancy like difference in spelling of names in two different document.

Also this sort of legislature might provide a precedent for such discriminatory laws in future too. Then it might reduce the non bjp vote base and help bjp that way too. The innumerable ramifications of this law is just sooo fucked up it sort of is mind-blowing in a way. > So India born Hindus and other minorities like Sikhs or Parsis or Siddis can also get fucked, right?

No. Amit Shah said no documents would be required as proof It affects poor Hindus who are too poor to protest or to understand the consequences. You are partially right but also wrong. The intent of NRC, however malicious it is, is to identify illegal immigrants and not make anyone without a document an illegal immigrant. Let's take few scenarios to understand better.

A Sikh/Jain anywhere in India who is not able to prove that he is a legal citizen of India is automatically assumed that he is from India/Pakistan(Erstwhile British Raj) and hence given citizenship through CAA.

All non-Tamil Hindus anywhere in India who is not able to prove that he is a legal citizen of India is automatically assumed that he is from India/Pak/Bangladesh (Erstwhile British Raj) and hence given citizenship through CAA. For instance, a Bengali Hindu can either be from India or Bangladesh. Similarly, a Hindu is Punjab/Kashmir can either be from India or Pakistan. A  Marathi/Kanadiga Hindu even if they are not able to prove, they could not have come from anywhere else. 

A  Buddhist/Christian who is not able to prove that he is a legal citizen of India will have to claim that he is from PAk/Afg/BD. Depending on mother tongue and facial features, the govt would know whether what he claims is true or if he could be from Tibet/Bhutan/SL. So they will give citizenship through CAA on case to case basis.

Bhai. Bhai. This is the problem you people.

NO THEY WONT BE GIVEN CITIZENSHIP AFTER 11 YEARS. ITS NOT FOR ILLEGAL MIGRANTS AND ENEMY ALIENS.   

CITIZENSHIP ACT 2004 ALSO CLEARLY SAYS YOU GET CITIZENSHIP ONLY IF YOU ARENT THE SON OR DAUGHTER OF AN ILLEGAL MIGRANT.

SO THEIR FUTURE GENERATIONS WONT BE CITIZENS TOO. Yes, another fact that's not mentioned enough is that the CAA in inself is bad for all Indians as the Assamese have realised. CAA is essentially citizenship in exchange for votes. And is against our national interest, assuming that we don't want to encourage more low skilled migration into India. Its also a security hole, as has been pointed out in the IB report itself.

The fact that Bhakts are burning the country and compromising national security so that immigrants get a better life is something that should be highlighted more, as that's something that's totally against right wing policies.

If we want to get to right wingers, we need to talk about the issues *they* are interested in, not what the left is concerned about. I'll just leave [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i33V2Fj_X9U) here.",Politics

All of these Islamic countries also have persecuted Muslims - Shias, Ahmediyas.

Also, you're again not seeing this in light with the NRC that the government has maintained they will implement. Search for posts explaining why this simplistic reasoning you have given is wrong, lots of them on reddit.

Lastly the Congress did table the bill, but it's implementation and execution is being maliciously used by the current govt. You can dm me if you want more clarification and if you still feel you don't understand this.

This should have been done long ago. But we are doing it now. We don’t have any clue as to where and how’s of the people. NRC will solve that. It has two sections of which the first one asks for at least one of 16 basic documents.


So a ""lawyer"" says its good without giving any reason why its good and I should take his word for it? You can learn from the fact that

1. If it is as good as govt says, then why would they not hold one simple press conference to clear the doubts. 

2. While 20 people have died in protests, govt keeps insisting its good but won't answer the questions the public is demanding, instead they keep parroting their own newspeak and then deflects the question back to us! What audacity.

The questions the public has are only a handful. Half a dozen questions will wrap up the full press conference.

When people are dying everyday, Internet is shutdown in 9 states, UP is on a lockdown and police brutality is clear as day, Why wouldn't they hold one single live press conference which will resolve all things in one sweep.

Instead tadipaar comes on at tv channels which are biased towards BJP and say the same things. Why wouldn't he come on at NDTV? 

Listen to any of his interviews on CAA/NRC, does he even let the interviewer speak? ""Nahi ruko aap meri baat suno, nahi ruko"" Abe tum question toh suno, aur usi ka answer do, diversion kyu ?

Do some critical thinking.

A man with true and honest intentions will never have to use diversionary tactics and neither would he need to blame others or the past. You've asked all this to a bhakt lawyer. Silly mistake to make if you ask me Please go and read the stickied posts. All of these have been debunked.

This is beautifully written. Can't disagree with any of it. Do you believe all of this will end in a remotely democratic manner? As in bjp's removal through elections? Or is it likely all bloodbath and genocide from here on culminating in civil wars and perhaps even foreign interference. As much as I agree with the spirit of this post, I completely disagree with the substance - or rather, your interpretation of India.

This isn't about _ghar wapsi_ or about Modi or, indeed, the BJP (scum though they are). This is about the creation of India as a political entity since before 1947. You see, it's this bit:

> And we certainly disagree on the definition of a ‘nation’. Hindu Rashtra and Hindu nationalism violate the Constitution. And turning India into a theocracy like Iran is what Modi and Shah and the Sangh Parivar machinery wants to do. Can Modi say under oath that he does not want to convert India into Hindu Rashtra? Can the bhakts say so?


The Constitution is only valid so long as the people of the country choose to hold it as valid. Pieces of paper have no power or sovereignty, they derive sovereignty from the people. The people have chosen to reject the constitution, because here's the kicker - the constitution and India are, and have always been, an inherently instable construct. The ideas of a secular India has always been deeply antithetical precisely because India is _not_ a nation by any rational definition of a nation. India is a hastily cobbled-together post-colonial creation that validates itself solely by creating an enemy - first the British Empire (justifiably so) and then Pakistan (unjustifiable) and Bangladesh (horrendously cruel).

It is these chickens that are, today, coming home to roost, because India's latent Hindutva was incredible easy to exploit. It always existed, it just lacked someone to point it out. And now that people are told that their Hindutva is threatened, the only justification they have always given themselves for the existence of their nation is collapsing, and they will shred the institutions meant to keep democracy safe just to keep their Hindu project safe.

India should never happened - the country was a post-colonial error, Britain's final kick to south Asia, and pretending it could ever be a secular country was a mistake. Secular nations are built on tangible cultures and cultural beliefs with concrete identities, like European nations, or Indian states. India was always Hindutva, and Hindutva was always India - all it lacked was the spark to set fire to the hatred and xenophobia that always existed, because that hatred is what justifies India's existence.

Tear the Republic down and demand statehood for your state, which is currently subjugated by India and Indianness. Sovereignty derives from a mandate of people living in consensus, and India will never have consensus that isn't phony and manufactured. That is the only way you can guarantee a better future for those not particularly religiously inclined. The idea of a Nation is based on commonality of language&culture. We preach ""Unity in Diversity"" and at the same time we also preach others to be ""Indian First"". These 2 messages are contradictory, why do we have to forgo our cultural identities to be an ""Indian"" if being Indian is just embracing the diversity?   Therein lies the ***real*** problem, the so called National Politics is stuck in a time capsule of North Centric Post-Partition Hindu-Muslim conflict. There is no nuance or logic to this narrative, BJP considers Hindu Nation as a foregone conclusion based on Partition whereas the other side doesn't have any retort other than ""let's not be a Hindu Pakistan"".

Liberals have lost the ideological battle because they're living in their own little worlds where they imagine India to be something its not. Majority of Indians don't give a damn about Progressive liberal beliefs and are drawn towards Charismatic leaders who talk in platitudes. What is the alternative to Modi? RAGA? Secularism is a noble State policy but it cannot be the only basis for a Nation. The ONLY ideological challenge Hindutva currently faces is Nativism from states such as Tamil Nadu&Bengal. Assamese opposition to CAB is also the same phenomenon, Assamese speakers have fallen below 50% in their own state and they don't want to fall any lower than that. 

>Forget Hindu texts, they don’t even have to study the Constitution

Liberals have spent the better part of 70+ years deconstructing and pointing out all the flaws of Hinduism but have done little to no attempt at highlighting the GOOD aspects of Hinduism to create a positive liberal Hindu identity. BJP has exploited this Hindu Identity vacuum by claiming that they understand&respect the good aspects of Hinduism,  people who would've sided with Liberals now side with BJP because they ""respect"" Hinduism, however superficial it may be.

>Islamophobia

You're playing right into BJP's hands by using this term. BJP can&will use an UNO reverse card and label you as HinduPhobic.  **BottomLine:**You CANNOT defeat Hindu Identity politics by appealing to secularism&constitution ad nauseam.  You have to create a political Liberal Hindu identity in opposition to their bigoted one and market it to the masses. That is the only way i can see Hindutva going down. In summary:

1. BJP wants to change India into Hindu Rashtra
2. Muslims, Christians, Dalits and people who take the Constitution and secularism seriously will oppose that
3. Hence the BJP is hiding its intentions now; it has to change people's perceptions to normalize Hindutva even more than it is normalized currently
4. So how does it justify its fascism? By creating the conditions necessary for its justification
5. Muslims protesting in the streets will be portrayed as 'Pakistanis' or 'jihadis' who want India to become an Islamic state
6. Students will be seen as supporting Pakistan and jihadis, hence anti-nationals; they want to break India into pieces
7. Intellectuals are anti-nationals and urban Naxals, maybe even supporting China
8. Slurs such as these were merely slurs, not to be taken seriously, but now they'll become actual accusations (with perhaps legal, or extra-legal, consequences)
9. A conflict with Pakistan, or a very tangible fear of one, will help these slurs become real accusations
10. Thus BJP can justify further fascist policies like detention centres (which they deny now), and even unthinkable ones",Politics

>Does this mean that Muslims from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan can never get Indian citizenship?  
>  
>No, the present legal process of acquiring Indian citizenship by any foreigner of any category through Naturalization (Section 6 of the Citizenship Act) or through Registration (Section 5 of the Act) stays operational. The CAA does not amend or alter it in any manner whatsoever. Hundreds of Muslims migrating from these three countries have been granted Indian citizenship during the last few years. If found eligible, all such future migrants shall also get Indian citizenship, irrespective of their numbers or religion. In 2014, after the settlement of Indo-Bangladesh boundary issues, 14,864 Bangladeshi citizens were given the Indian Citizenship when their enclaves were incorporated into the territory of India. Thousands of these foreigners were Muslims.

You've asserted:

>So there is no way for a Muslim refugee from those 3 countries to come to India. They can never get Indian citizenship. No, they don't have to go through the ""usual process of acquiring citizenship"".

Am I missing something? Hey, since you seem to have a good grasp about the issue, can you please help me identify the core issue with CAA+NRC. 

From what I can see as of now it discriminates muslims from outside India (especially the Rohingyas). 


I feel there is some merit to the point that giving citizenship to Muslims from Bangladesh Pakistan is not needed (I have an open mind about the issue, please convince me if you can why this is wrong - But please dont just say India is secular and it discriminates).


Also, from what I can see, as of now the Indian Muslims are safe. As the criteria for NRC has not been announced for people outside Assam so like I mentioned in the other comment, saying we are sure they(Indian Muslims) will be asked to provide extraordinary proof is not a solid ground for protests as it has not been announced.


(Once again I really want to understand why this is wrong, so that I can educate others. Just saying secular and discrimination and Indian constitution is not an educated argument. Thanks if you reply for this. I want to spread this information around because everyone near me is just saying Congress/Jihadis are behind the protests and I can only convince them once I am fully convinced). u/rahulthewall If you want can add this document link to your post for visibility please.

>Indian Muslims will now require extraordinary proof

What is the extraordinary proof that will be required and how will it be different from the proof that non-Muslim-non migrants will require?

If you are not in the special case covered by the CAA, you'll be subject to rest of The Citizenship Act, 1955, which lays out [four principal ways](https://indiancitizenshiponline.nic.in/acquisition1.htm) through which Indian citizenship can be acquired (Birth, Descent, Registration and Naturalization). Wouldn't a lot of people be eligible at least to acquire citizenship by naturalization? As far as I know, the 1955 act applies to every person irrespective of their religion. Only the CAA lays out a special condition for non-muslim migrants from three countries, that of a reduced time (five years) to be eligible for naturalization.

The purpose of the NRC would be to make sure that everybody tagged as an Indian citizen has the documented proofs that establishes at least one of the four principal requirements under the 1955 act, namely Birth, Descent, Registration and Naturalization.

For example, one of the proofs would be something that can establish that you have been a resident of India for 12 years, so that you're eligible for citizenship by naturalization. My understanding is that it's not that hard to demonstrate that you have been resident in India for twelve years for most people.

It might be hard for the homeless but wouldn't that be a problem for everybody? Including non-muslims who aren't migrants? Because the CAA only applies to non-muslims **who are also** migrants from those three countries and have been a resident of India since at least 31 December 2014.

And even if you don't have documented proof there are other provisions [such as  witnesses or local proofs supported by members of the community, as clarified by the MHA Spokesperson yesterday](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/no-indian-will-have-to-prove-ancestry-common-documents-will-be-enough-mha-1630201-2019-12-20).

I think that people might be confusing the Assam NRC process for the one that will be implemented nationwide. The Assam NRC guidelines were laid out by the Supreme Court in 2015 specifically for Assam and as of today no official guideline, or process or procedure exists for the nationwide NRC exercise.

So I'm not sure if it's right to be jumping to conclusions if we don't even know what the nationwide NRC exercise will look like.

Media (Social and traditional) especially had a prominent role in demonizing the UPA and whitewashing the NDA, and this continues to today. 

Why do I say this?

The allegations against NDA seldom receive coverage and nowhere to the extent UPA did.

Lokpal was not passed by this Govt until th SC forced them and no subsequent protest by Hazare has received much coverage. Except for JNU (always negatively covered), no protest receives coverage. Even the farmer march in Bombay received attention only once the farmers were already in Mumbai. 

A rape case in a non NDA state (Telangana) immediately became a national case like Nirbhaya meanwhile the Unnao case in an NDA state (Uttar Pradesh) and an NDA leader where the accused was openly trying to and finally succeeding in killing the victim has still not reached same level of boil the Nirbhaya and Disha cases did.

Meanwhile NDA passes laws to anonymize political funding and BJP becomes the richest party. Then the sale of State assets (BPCL) at losses begins and no CAG to say anything. RTI is diluted, Aadhar to keep track of people, tax cuts for corporates

Standard /r/ABoringDystopia >Sanghvi’s reasoning was that Modi would be a polarizing leader, enthusing the BJP’s base but alienating the undecided voter. 

Man did Sanghvi and Congress got that horribly wrong. They've probably assumed than an average Indian voter is not a bigot at heart. That they have some sort of moral compass. > but if you think of the enthusiasm for Modi expressed by men like Ratan Tata, Sunil Mittal and the Ambani brothers, scarcely your average Sangh cadre members, it’s hard to feel reassured. If Modi leads the BJP into the next general election, one of the country’s two largest parties will ask the electorate to vote into the prime ministership a man alleged to have presided over violent pogroms and ethnic cleansing. Even if the BJP were to lose, it is likely that a substantial percentage of India’s electorate will vote for the party Modi represents; and thereby a line will have been crossed. If it were to win, we will have sanctioned an Inquisition.

"Need help understanding the Citizenship Ammendment Bill 2019  To begin with, persecuted minorities, refugees, etc are all clever, politically correct distractions to mask the true purpose of this bill.

To understand its true purpose, you have to understand another upcoming policy (probably from April 2020) called NRC.

NRC's purpose is to declare who is a genuine Indian citizen and who is an ""illegal"" resident. Its criteria are based on ancestral documents - basically all of us have to show our grandpa or great grandpa or some such was also a resident of India. The process is very stringent with multiple checks, tribunals, anybody with a grudge can object to your claims, etc.

Being a documentation poor country as well as due to reasons like passage of time, estrangement of families, and so on, a lot of people of all communities will not be able to successfully prove their ancestral residency. To give an idea of the numbers, NRC's already done in one state and upto 1 million hindus and 1 million muslims were unable to prove it. So project that to 30 states with different populations and you're talking perhaps 200 million people deemed ""illegal"".

This is where CAB enters the picture. It allows the hindu, sikh, parsi, jain, xtian, buddhist ""illegals"" to be declared citizens again with voting rights. But because CAB does not allow muslims, it basically strips Indian muslim residents of citizenship and rights, including voting rights.

Martin Niemoller > I cannot help but agree with the fundamental idea of the CAB.


If they keep changing the criteria of who is and who isnt Indian, it is only a matter of time before your turn comes. Reinstitute Birthright citizenship then. There would be no need of such divisive bills. First of all, Sylheti Hindus are not the only minorities that were persecuted.

And secondly, here is how the govt could have handled this without CAB. They could have made Sylheti Hindus legal migrants and then in 12 years they would have got Citizenship through existing process. [Please read this as to how Modi govt has been selectively given citizenship and other rights to specific refugees](https://scroll.in/article/946220/no-law-for-refugees-in-india-and-the-citizenship-bill-does-not-fill-the-gap). They could have done the same in your example. >Faced with religious persecution (read: genocide), a lot of Sylheti Hindus crossed their way into India. The way I see it, the CAB is only a means to give them the Indian citizenship they deserve.

If that is the aim, The CAB can remove the reference to religion and just say persecuted community.

As you said they just want muslims out of electoral role.That is the fundamenta idea of CAB. They can not deport them.

"Rant: In India everything matters except the real issues.  I am not an Indian, but I share and appreciate your passion about social issued. I met many India friends here at America. I learned from them  about Indian politics, religions and histories from time to time. 

I am amazed by how India hold itself together as the world's largest democratic country,  overcoming the sheer amount of the fractions or diversities within the the society. Dialects, religions, sub-caste systems, custums, to name a few.  This is quite an accomplishment in itself.

It's difficult to move forward in unison without a center of gravity holding different parts together.  Nationalism and tribalism are such examples, good or bad.

My question is this: in your opinion, what are other viable 'center of gravity' which could serve the purpose as unifying forces for society,  large or small? Just a curiousity. Thanks! You seem to come from a more traditional/conservative family OP. In mine, all of the forced feet touching, forced pooja attending, fake reverence for all elders died out a generation ago.

My father does it occasionally when he wants to, and my siblings and me never do it. 

In fact we are all atheists, and when elders make ridiculous Facebook or what's app based claims, we debunk them on the spot. 

It helps that most of my siblings and me are around 30 now and we are quite successful in our own fields. Indians does not wanna accept that our country is flawed and our customs are broken.

We can't fix it if we won't even admit that it's broken. VS Naipaul vividly described this effect as an “inability to see” - read “An Area of Darkness” for an articulate description of this syndrome. This fake superiority complex is one of the biggest problem of this country, which believes that the Indian/Desi style of doing things or the Desi culture is the only correct way. Anyone who has a differing opinion is shot down to shreds.

It is also really sad that **Super-Power by 2020**, a dream that Dr. Kalam held so preciously is now nothing but a meme material in the current socio-political scenario. We do. And only we could fix it. Our parents and older relatives are set in their ways and I don't see that changing. So the onus falls on us to fix it. I suppose, once you settle into the bowels of any society, all that remains are problems, maybe of varying degrees, but problems nonetheless and that is not necessarily bad, perhaps life lies in the battle itself, "" ONE makes the many, hence ONE cannot be NONE"" so I gues it's not about being passive and Optimistic, but more like a pessimism of strength a kind that makes you aware but not hopeless but leads to be a more active participant into the profession you choose to serve society and the personality and beliefs you offer to your peers and the coming generation. Keep ranting to everyone you know in real life. Most will think you're spoilt, but a few will realize they're being idiots following other idiots rather than figuring things out for themselves. Change comes gradually if you try, and not at all if you don't. I have found a formula to short circuit all this bullshit. Does the elder person in point pays your bills or makes your life easier in any way? If yes, go ahead and show some respect. If not, say hi and move on.

I have had enough bad experiences with so called relatives (including breaking my relationship apart) that I give zero fucks if I lose a shred of contact with them. Your parents will eventually understand your position. 

I always say to my parents that those ‘chaar log’ have destroyed dreams of god knows how many children in this country. Take care of yourself first. Because your relatives will always take care of their children first, even if their children go against the very culture that the relatives are forcing on you (they would celebrate and even brag about their children working/studying in a foreign country, but will choke the ‘culture’ down your throats if you decide to do the same)

Fuck’em. I broadly agree with you on this, but one shouldn't really be dismissive of others' wisdom and experience. The Indian education system has been a major screw up, but this has got to do with a lot more. From a bird's eye perspective, I see a sheer lack of organizational skills among Indians as a group. One can't really count on the Indian execution of tasks. There tends to be a systematic lack of discipline in most sectors. But there's another way of looking at it. India wasn't an industrialized nation in the 19th century. Even to this day, India is an agrarian economy. During and forth proto-industrialization era, labour had become more organized due to added machinery, and so forth. India on the other hand, being a agro-based country missed the bus, to discipline-land and development-land. Lot of it boils down to our culture.

"The true purpose of reservations in India is not economic upliftment, but social inclusion.  Do you think it is working? What I see is that even otherwise reasonable people get angay and resentful when they talk about reservation. I personally know a few people who talks about sc/st people in extremely bad manner. They weren't like this before entrance examinations after 12th. Now, whenever we discuss about writing PSC examinations, they are like 'Enthina? Kanda polyadikku okke kittum. Nammalu ezhuthiyikk karyamilla' Meaning: For what? Only low caste people(expletive) will benefit from such examinations and we won't get any benefit.

Another thing I have noticed is that these same people are getting more crazy about religion, especially Hindus. They feel that there is no one else to support them. So, reservations don't reinforce already existing caste distinctions in Society? Economic based scholarships would go a long way in alleviating this rather than reservation in jobs.

Once you have education in your mind, you get a certain level of self-awareness and self-respect. > The Scheduled Castes (or SCs) have been treated worse. These communities were classified as social outcasts and were often forced to live outside the village. They weren't allowed to draw water from the same well as the rest of the village, they weren't allowed to visit the temple or take part in the communal activities such as festivals or decision making. They provided an important source of agricultural labour in villages (and still do) and performed menial jobs in the cities that were ritually considered impure or dirty. The agricultural economy would collapse if their labour was not available and sanitation would have been non-existent in the cities without the Dalits to clean the toilets and clear the corpses. And yet, they were not part of the conversation when it came to society. They have never had a voice, a say in the decisions that are made when the community gets together and makes a collective decision. They have been exploited physically, economically, and socially by all and sundry. Their status has been little better than slaves. They are an important part of Indian society but have little to no say in the affairs of the country or the state, and yet they are counted as citizens of India.


Ok, I'm a dalit. I've trying to learn about the history of dalits for a long time. Although what you've written seems like the dominant narrative. I think the truth could be much more sinister. 

In TN, where I live, the Dalit communities in ancient times still lived outside these agricultural societies. But there are several cultural practices, that would turn the idea that dalits were looked down upon. Several rituals in marriages and temple functions etc have a respectable role for members of these castes and receive their blessings. Some temple festivals start with the first ritual being performed from by a member of pariayar community. Then there's that sangam poetry which puts the paraiyar community as one of the noble communities. So there is a lot we are missing here.

But looking at the recent Y-DNA results and the cultural practices of the past. It's possible there was a shift in religious practices that resulted in the dehumanization of dalits. Dalits are most likely the descendants of the tribals that lived in the periphery of the cities. They lived in separate settlements because they are culturally hunter-gatherers. And there definitely was some mixing in the absence of a caste system. And they lived peacefully becacuse the post IVC agricultural societies knew they are descended from hunter-gatherer societies themselves and had hunter-gatherer gods such as Sivan and Murugan. 

The shift is the Sanskritisation of Tamil culture with the arrival of more vedic-leaning brahmins. I think there were other brahmins before who had integrated with Tamil culture and were okay with adopting local traditions. This could be one of the cause for the schisms that exist between iyers and iyengars in TN.  The beginning of the caste system and sanskritization of TN culture would have pushed dalits outside Tamil society in a power struggle for the cultural space of the Tamils with the brahmins winning. Today there are still remnants of this struggle. Lot of old kula deivam temples employ dalits as the priests out of tradition. 

So yea, in the last 1500 years condition of dalits have deteriorated to that of slaves. It just wasn't always like that. I'm a Brahmin too and yes I am not against the reservation but against the efficiency of reservation, my family was extremely poor and my father used to pull rickshaw and worked in a Hotel ( Included cleaning Hotel's toilet about 10 years ago ).

while I've seen abject poverty and with a family of five hardly managing food. In Urban area's most of Upper caste are never different from any other poor, even back in our village the situations have changed with hardly any opportunity  left .There was no government scheme that would help us. That's not just us but most of the relatives back  in the rural area.

Before giving my AIEEE and making it to an NIT, I didn't hardly ate anything for 2 days but water.

I remember my first day of college, where my room mate whose father had association with BAMCEF and grilled me for 15 minutes, as if I was going to discriminate his son. Ultimately he became a good friend despite his father brainwashing him when we parted from the college, to an extent that he admitted and hated the reservation system himself. Through years, he came to know about the fact that poverty strikes both Dalits and Upper caste the same way atleast in Urban areas. Dalits in rural areas no doubt have it worse, and even in Urban areas there is discrimination but it's certainly decreasing. His father was a professor in known college of UP, and he had a relatively cushioned life. Right now there is a generation of Dalits which has reaped benefits of reservation and are not willing to leave the same for the needs of the others.

If after 70 years of independence, if these efforts have ""hardly"" improved anything then don't you think there is something wrong with the reservation policies ?  By the current pace of improvements in life of Rural Dalits who are real victim, it's going to take 1000's of years. Back in the village a Dalit Family still faces a lot of discrimination, the situation in Urban areas have improved compared to that. The reservation should preferably be given Rural Dalits and then anyone else.

1. How do you measure social opportunity?
2. Do you believe OBC reservations  are a evil\\necessary evil or are they justice?
3. Why do you believe ""justice"" against those not guilty of discrimination is not evil? 
4. What social opportunities are available to a lower middle class Jat\\Kshatriya that are not available to a Sr level SC govt employees kid and how does an IIT reserved seat help the kid get those? Correct me if I’m wrong. But wasn’t the original purpose of reservation to uplift minorities in a certain amount of years and then remove it when equality( economically and socially) for all people is reached but then every politician decided to just use it for votes instead of actually uplifting the minorities. Truth is their are not much gov jobs compared to increasing population of India. Reservation in job doesn’t matter much.

secondly talking about merit based admission in colleges their are not much good quality of institute apart from IIMs and IITs and few other.  and IITs are also not that extraordinary. so pro-reservation lobby must understand that all students from sc/st/obc generally are less talented than 50% of the class. and it is very likely they will remain below avrg in their Batch. only top 5% or 10% are winners at the end of 3/4 years degree. 
and people against reservation complaining sc/st/obc stealing their seats they need to under that even reservation is removed u won’t amount much. 

I see whole reservation thing as dividing India more than actually helping SC/ST/OBC.  
their was a reason ambedkar did not want reservation forever.

Below is my comment on [a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/d5cvwf/shower_thought_bjp_is_trying_to_distract_us_from/?utm_source=reddit-android) yesterday, where discussion was on about Hindi imposition is non-issue, just a gimmick and Center is using it to divert peoples attention.

**Well, No. Center is serious about making Hindi second (compulsory) language in every state.**

>Wait a minute, do you really think Hindi imposition is a non-issue?

>Government can take it to court, Court is their lap dog, they can definitely declare Hindi as national Language besides English. And bingo, your own mothertongue will be third language of your state, behind English and Hindi. Once that done, in year or two they will creep Hindi in every states educational curriculum. & in future, Your kid will  proudly say, हिंदी हमारी राष्ट्रभाषा है |

Amit Shah is crazy Crazy guy, even crazier than Modi himself. He will not let this go. They've North, west east India but south, Not yet. Language is the barrier and they will try to break it down.

So be ready to fend off this seemingly inevitable incoming imposition. I request to all of you to use your mothertongue liberally, especially with younger generation. English is fine, they'll learn it in school but at home DO convers in your mothertongue only. Why what is wrong with ""doing politics"" ? Your party has been ""doing politics"" of the worst kind ... ah, a liar and an enthno-nationalist >If some people want to do politics, its their choice.

If some people don't want to learn Hindi, its their choice. The question isn't about learning one extra language. Almost everyone in india is bi-lingual.

Question is which language should be second language? A global language like English which is more than enough to communicate with the world and excess large set of knowledge r Hindi which has no practical purpose left anymore. 

My first language is Hindi but I don't know when was last time I used it for my exams or professional communication. 

For an Indian with non-hindi mother tongue it is absolutely wrong to ask them to learn 2 extra languages, one to communicate with other Indians and one for the world when only one language (English) is sufficient for both the purpose. 

This is nothing but imposing a non existent supremacy. Sanghis are moron. If hindi is 2nd language, what will be status of English? Ok, good we got that out of the way.

Can we talk about the economy now? and just like that , the attention is diverted from the economy Bhakts outside of the Hindi belt are, and will always be, utter fucking morons. Learn English lol why the fuck should anyone learn Hindi, a localised language?",Politics
"Pros and cons of living in Hyderabad. Feel free to add your perspectives or discuss how your city is better than Hyderabad in the cons department I mentioned here  Pros:
1. Affordable - Both the rent as well as cost of public transport.
2. Food - Had to go on diet after putting on weight due to the abundance of cheap biriyanis.
3. Roads - Most of the major roads are well maintained, especially in Hitech city areas. Driving in ORR is a pleasure. 
4. People - Coming from north India it shocks me how simple and friendly people are here. Never had a rude conversation with strangers. Road rage here means that the drivers will yell at each other in Telugu and they go their ways. 
5. Safety - Burglary, theft and even pickpocketing is rare. In my 4+ years of living here, did not hear a case of mobile or wallet theft in public transport from either colleagues or friends. My friends usually keep their apartment door unlocked overnight since the cook comes early in the morning and nobody wants to wake up and unlock the door. I have heard the same story from many other people.
6. Language: A south Indian city where almost everyone speaks or understands Hindi is rare.

Cons:
1. Water: As many people said, water supply is scarce. Many societies need round the year tanker supply. Fortunately, for us its just the months of April-June. Rainfall was bad last few years but its good this year so I am hoping it would be a less issue next year.
2. Driving: As nice people are here, they drive like maniacs. Blocking free left - check, Not giving signal before turning - check, Driving on the wrong side of the road - double check. Also the traffic police is much more lenient that other cities such as Bangalore.
3. Nightlife: Although there are many places for nightlife, especially around Jubilee Hills, the majority of the crowd is north Indians. People here are very orthodox and women usually would not go out. The Tinder scene here will make you cry.
4. Public transport: Apart from the metro, which is great BTW as it covers the full length & breadth of the city, and Pushpak airport buses, the general public transport sucks. Buses are rickety with confusing routes and numbers. There are shared autos but going from one point to another would require you to change 2-3 autos. There is no meter system to you have to stick to haggling in case you decide to book an auto. Hence, people here stick to personal vehicles for office commute. No points about food..? Primary reason i want to visit again..! You forgot the biggest con, water scarcity. You have to fucking survive on bottled water for drinking and water tankers for other purposes. There's no water. Enough said. Pros: food (how did you miss this?)


Cons: nightlife It rained like fuck tonight Osmania is a state university and not a central university. And yes, there are not many good arts colleges (probably because there is no demand at all for good quality arts colleges). Cons: No good weekend getaways. (Change my mind)

And by that I mean, all good places to visit are 14-15 hours away (Goa, Kodai etc.). The only 8 hour drive destination is Hampi I disagree on the ""safe for women"" part. I have had my worst experiences of traveling solo while living in Hyderabad. Stalking was extremely common. Many of my female friends got frisked by passing by bikers and autos while walking. It was almost a norm to be called out ""hey baby"" while crossing the road. Sorry, this is almost on tangent to your thread. But hyd has a huge ""road Romeo"" issue. I noped the hell out of that place. Biryani! \> It's affordable for anybody.

\- Lol which part of the city do you live in. Rents in Gachibowli/Financial are sky high. 40-50k for a 3BHK in a gated community is not cheap.

\- Public transport, not just RTC buses is a mess in Hyd. The public transport infrastructure is next to non existent in the industrial/IT area, and Ola/Uber are the only choice apart from shared autos (which only run in selected routes).

\- Power cuts are pretty common. Lived in other metros and barely saw any power cuts.

\- Summers are hot for sure. But calling winters extremely harsh is too big of an overstatement. If you have lived above the tropics in India (not the hills, even the plains), you would know what winters actually mean.",Non-Political
"Another arranged marriage rant. [serious]  I'm genuinely curious.

Why all the matrimonial profiles are managed by the parents instead of the actual bride/groom? Time is ticking? You are only 27. I feel you actually have time to check out the dating scene and then come back to arranged marriage once you and people around grow desperate. 

You are very right in not being able to judge people in just the five minute facade they put in front of you. Couldn't you just add a line in your profile that goes I'd like to meet the boy and get to know him before decision? That'd filter out all the mismatches right? Can you get their number off the website and drop a text maybe? I posted an arranged marrige question the other day. We are of the same age. I have been through this process for about one year now.

Let me know if you would like to talk. I can maybe help you out. 1.) Manage your own matrimonial profile 

2.) Stay away from profiles managed by parents. There are plenty of guys who manage their own profiles.

3.) Select a guy who you think your family will not have any objections to.

4.) Strike up a conversation , see if you guys click. Meet up if you want to go to the next level. 

5.) Now if you think there's some potential here. Involve your parents. 

6.) Assuming you did a good job with #3. They should not have any objections. 

7.) Engagement. Marriage after few months. 

Ofcourse this all assuming you really are liberal and non-religious. Most girls who advertise as such on matrimonial profiles still have a problem if the guy is from a different caste or if astrology doesn't match or some other bullshit. 

Which lowers the number of eligible men who would satisfy your criteria I really feel for all the women in india who go through this and also most of the guys.   


I had a classmate, very ambitious girl, wanted to marry someone else, but her parents forced her to marry this other older dude who was in their cast. There was a lot of resistance from her, her friends, but eventually her fam physically forced her to get married.

I dont know how this doesnt count for a crime. She s now all depressed, and without any ambitions. You can marry me, I even have a reddit account.

Well I am just 21 but my brother is 28-29.
I don't know his exact age but he's kind of going through the same thing to the point my father became frustrated and said in a more gentle and civilised version of "" I don't give a fuck. I quit. Do whatever the fuck you want to do."" I tried talking sense to my father but he straight out underestimates me and so does my brother. According to my father, he has a plan set according to him. Road map about my brother's life . So far he's seen more than 10 girls and I feel grotesque that and say what if it was your daughter and men came to see her.I also have an older sister . Parents are forgetting that we are not their burden and even if we are, we can find a way to make things right after their demise just like them, the way they did.  It's just becomes something pathetic when the topic of marriage comes. Most parents don't act out of intellect or instinct but society. I try to speak reason with my father but he's just adamant. I mean marriage is no joke. Granted one can file for divorce but why let that situation arise by making the wrong decision in the first place. If you're doing a job then it'll be best to confront your parents regarding what you want because the hardcore fact is, if you leave a crucial part of your life's decision in their hands and not make it yours then I think you may get lost. Parents should let their children make mistakes and guide them instead of taking control .
I love my parents but I disagree with them on a lot of things because even I want to be like them I also want to find out about me.
Sometimes a simple ""Fuck you I don't give a fuck about what you think"" goes a long way in protecting your solidarity and integrity than conforming to traditions which are most often outdated.

Edit 
P.S. I do give a fuck if it's reasonable [removed] Drop the idea of arranged marriage Keep an eye out for profiles created by ""Self"". Parents are usually a nuisance factor. Let's be honest, parents are likely to live less longer than you guys and so their opinion should get lesser weight. If a fully grown ass person needs their parents to shop for a partner in these malls called matrimonial apps, this guy is not strong enough to be relied upon during and after climate apocalypses. no matter how long it takes...don't succumb to the pressure. no matter what. keep waiting.. until you actually meet someone outside of matrimony site maybe? I suppose you can look for yourself as well, right?",Non-Political

This is a very good initiative and deserves appreciation. 

Some suggestion:

- The current format brings attention but is not suitable to stimulate a discussion because of the wide variety of topics listed. Reddit works because each thread is about one topic (roughly put), and it attracts those who are interested in discussing that particular subject. 

- Instead of collecting everything in one single thread, I'd rather that the mods split them by topics into separate threads. 

- Personally, I feel the ""community policing"" model of reddit in general is failing because of vote manipulation by vested interests. (This initiative is a good example for this). 

- As such, I feel the mods here should be bolder - don't just help with the policing of the community but be more active contributors by becoming editors (or nominate or elect members from the community to be ""editors"").

- The task of of the ""editor"" should be as it is in any modern publication or media outlet - sift though the 100's or thousands of moderated content submitted everyday and highlight content that the r/india community should be more aware of, discuss and debate. 

- For this, the mods shouldn't be afraid to have more than 2 sticky threads on the front page. (In fact, personally I'd be comfortable with up to 5-6 stickies every day.)

- Thus stickies by community ""editors"" and the generally community contributed upvoted / debated content on the front page should make things more interesting here and also help more in creating harder to manipulate community with better content.

"Can we have a IndiaPolitik subreddit which focused on political knowledge rather than political news/opinion?  In the day when opinions are showcased as knowledge, I doubt it would really matter unless you define what qualifies someone politically knowledgeable There is already a sub named Indian Politics. It's listed in related subreddits of this community. I would love to be a part of this but there needs to be strict moderation. We wouldn't want it to end up like certain low-quality subs. I totally agree. I would suggest calling it r/IndiaPolicy and explicitly have a rule that political discussions are not allowed. I know some people working for political parties as strategists / consultants, so there are many non-high-profile people who could contribute to discussion. Agreed, I would also suggest that we keep the name of the sub as r/IndianConstitution.

Hate to say this but this isn't recent. I was born in 90s but I still remember takloo Pandey unkill (what my dad used to call him) spitting tobacco on open roads. 

It is just that some of us have lead a very sheltered life to the extent that incidents like these look of foreign origin.

This has happened to me before, when I was with my other half. I head out, at the expense of missing the movie for a bit, get a hold of the manager, talk down to him, create a scene, ask for a refund, ask for the head office email, or supervisor, and that usually should do the trick. I threaten to call the cops if any physical attack happens and it usually ends in them talking to the nuisance creators. Take help of other people. Group together. Situational awareness. That's the key.

"Kashmiri here, how are you as a mainland Indian viewing the revelations from Kashmir? Has your perception about Kashmir changed by seeing the stark difference between govt propaganda and western media coverage?  Here's what I was told about Kashmir:

0. That there was an organic independence movement fuelled by the JLKF which was secular in nature.

1. That in the 80s JLKF receded into the background and Hizbul Mujahideen was propped up by Pakistan. After that,  the struggle for Azadi was fuelled by the desire for an Islamist state and Sharia law.

2. That 0.7 million pandits were then flushed out of the valley by Islamists who viewed them as an obstacle to their goal of a Muslim Kashmir.

3. That the State government stood by and watched as this happened.

4. That the centre sent in its army that committed more attrocites.

What I saw in the protest videos released by the BBC: protesters asking for azadi (freedom). One guy shouting ""azadi ka MATLAB kya?"" (Translation: ""what does freedom mean to us?"")And the crowd responding ""la Ila Allah.. something"" (translation: an Islamic state). The western media just confirmed what I had heard. 

Just my opinion: the human rights violations are wrong and should be condemned. But I have no sympathy for the Islamist freedom movement in Kashmir. They have the option to elect representatives and participate in a secular democracy. That's what I stand for. If they want an Islamic state they can go get one elsewhere. If they pelt stones in furtherance of an illegitimate objective then there should be an appropriate response. But I fully sympathize with the victims of the Indian army and the Islamists. I hope normalcy returns to the valley and that the citizens residing there can exercise their right to a democratically elected government that represents them. I've always believed Kashmir is for Kashmiris but since J&K was a princely state, we are in this predicament which would have been solved by partition.

I wanted to ask you a question actually - why is it that the Kashmiri opinion dominates the narrative when the sizeable population in Jammu and Ladakh are very happy with being in India and GB on the Pakistani side prefers to be with Pakistan. Isn't it the same majoritarianism that Kashmiris are wary off? Ok forget the media. I want to hear it from you. How's life? How was it, How is it? 1. Kashmir Dispute, like any other regional kingdom dispute is old. And yet for our freedom struggle all the princely states came together to topple the yoke of colonists. Every princely state in the Indus region was captured by one Invader in some century, and by another in the next and the continent divided up into kingdoms untill the East India Company took hold. Thats everybody's history, not just yours.
2. You think there was time to take into account ""Consent"" of the people? Or do you think thats how kingdoms work? A kingdom does what the King wishes and that is it. And Hari Singh thought he could keep Kashmir independent but with the Pakistani invaders moved in quickly he had no choice. India agreed to help, but Mountbatten insisted that Kashmir accede to India first to avoid a repeat. Hari Singh, seeing that the option for an Indipendent Kashmir was out the window decided its better to accede to India and that was that. There was no talk of a plebiscite by Hari Singh and the accession was unconditional, so understand that your King chose to annex to India. Autonomy isnt a right to any Kashmiri, anymore than it is to any state in India. The INC and Nehru/Gandhi being the gentle souls that they were offered to conduct plebiscite once things had settled down since they deeply believed in democracy and wanted the population to feel a part of the nation. So please understand that a plebiscite was an offer made AFTER accession was already formalized, an it was made as a goodwill gesture.
3. Sec 370 and 35a were both put in place to ease in the transition of Kashmir to India and were MEANT to be temporary provisions, but like any temporary provision that gives anyone power, they were never withdrawn because people could derive political mielage out of them. The goal ALWAYS was to assimilate Kashmir like any other state of India.
4. What happened in 1990's is a blot on the people of Kashmir, and pakistan as well as local governments are responsible for it. Also the spineless central leaderships inability to protect its citizens should not go unpunished. And you say Sikhs never left? What are you smoking? I am a Sikh, and I have family that left Kashmir. Do you know why the few that remained back did so - Because they had run away from Pakistan just a few decades ago giving up everything to start their lives from scratch, and refused to go through it again - they decided that if they are to die, they will die here. It wasnt hunky dory for them like you try to paint it to be. Several Sikhs stayed back in Pakistan as well, that doesn't mean Jack Shit.
5. You mean you are Indebted to the Indians living in Kashmir that have helped even those Kashmiris that dont feel they are Indians. Keep looking at your people as Kashmiri Sikhs, Kashmiri Muslims, Kashmiri Hindus etc instead of just as Kashmiris, and you will never be united.
6. I hope for the situation to get better soon, I believe we are getting closer to normalcy especially after todays news, and hope things get back to normal in Kashmir as soon as possible. This prolonged clampdown is not helping the integration of the people into India which is dearly needed to improve the economic condition of the region, and creating jobs and industry that can lead the region to growth.
7. One can only dream. Then imagine what we could have done if there was no India-Pakistan.
8. Indeed.
9. Disagreement never needs an apology. A dialogue is all that is needed, even if we end up disagreeing. Government got it wrong. 

We (common man) always want Kashmir to be a part of india and Kashmiris to feel home.

But if what foreign media is showing is true, we have fucked big time.

Problem with Amit Shah is that he has governed Gujarat where everyone pretty much toes his line. Its not possible to do the same in a country as diverse as india. Its a hopeless situation now. There are few of us who feel bad in the way Kashmiris were and are still being treated. It's these people who believe the international media reports. 

The majority of the people though believe that Kashmir became an integral part of India, finally, on 5th August 2019 thanks to the Iron Men Amit Shah and Modi. This majority are either too naive to not believe the international media reports (they think that it's a western conspiracy) or they feel that's necessary (this category thinks that every Kashmiri is a terrorist or separatist until proven otherwise) to curb any protests that might arise.

So the international media reports has done nothing to change the view of the people on the govt or Indian media. I've already known that the Indian media narrative on Kashmir was extremely flawed simply because the Indian media narrative on any topic that you actually become knowledgeable about suddenly becomes flawed. 

Like how almost every single caste related atrocity in India becomes this tale of the Upper caste Brahmins directly oppressing the poor Dalits when the truth is that post the land redistribution phase the most powerful caste in every village in India is an OBC or middle caste. The combination of wealth plus numbers has made them the deciding factor when it comes to politics and they have the muscle power as well. However, the media would like you to believe that it is solely the topmost layer oppressing the monolithic rest when it actually is the middle castes who are equally if not more bigoted against the lower castes. 

So the Indian media narrative about Kashmir too is just that, a narrative. Any incident which fits their narrative becomes data and the counter points become mere anecdotes. 

However, that said and done anyone who has ever spoken to Kashmiris will be astounded by their capacity to believe the most retarded bullshit. Till date easily 50% of Kashmiris believe that the reason the Kashmiri Pandits left was that Jagmohan secretly made a deal with lakhs of Pandits spread out throughout the valley and told them that you should leave for a while because otherwise the Indian Army would hesitate to kill the people there out of fear of killing a Brahmin. So Jagmohan and all the Pandits got into this conspiracy where they would temporarily leave and then they'll take all the property of the dead when they come back. I've lived in Srinagar and went out with a bunch of well educated and rich teens (my dad was friends with an NIT professor and these were his kids and their friends) and they told me this tale with the utmost seriousness. They weren't even anti India, they live in Delhi or work in Mumbai and have befriended Indians easily so you can well imagine the type of beliefs that the actually anti India crowd has. Before the abrogation I had no idea about article 370 and 35. I just knew it was a place of turmoil because of Pakistani presence, and there's a pok. When the news broke, I was on the fence. I was very shocked at the methods... first the exodus under the guise of Amarnath Yatra scare, the house arrests seemed illegal, the reverse introduction of the bill into rajya sabha first, the quitting (subsequent poaching?) of Congress whip... And I investigated further because I was frustrated with not understanding politics and feeling bad for my country, and I had the time because I was unemployed. 

Then I thoroughly believed the methods were wrong, the intention was wrong, the justification was a farce. But I still agreed with it because of how it crippled the military narrative of Pakistan. I read a bit about the propaganda they are taught there, decided it was best they are removed. And removal of the fiefdoms of Mufti and Omar was good.

The entire time I was concerned for Kashmiri people, had no information other than from BBC clips. That's true even today. No idea what's happening on the ground, what the people want, how many factions are there, etc.

What is your perspective? [deleted] > Kashmir dispute is older than Ind and Pakistan, repression is 5 centuries old.

Well, that is one perspective. From the point of view of the Republic of India, we didn't exist till 1947, so ""we"" did not have a dispute with anyone. 

> Accession happened without consent of public and that is why plebiscite was promised- to respect public opinion. And also it is the only peaceful agreement that has consent of both the nations and Kashmiris.

Kashmir was ruled by the Dogra Maharaja Hari Singh, and was one of the princely states of British India. All other princely states of India (there was around 200+ of them) were given the choice of accession b/w secular India and Muslim Pakistan (after all, it was the demand for Pakistan that created a choice). Said accession was final and irrevocable. In fact, the UN plebiscite that people talk about does *not* have a choice for an independent Kashmir. It is a choice b/w India and Pakistan, like all other states. The Maharaja thought he could play both sides and delayed the accession decision till Pakistan sent a bunch of ""tribals forces"" who were essentially militants.

What also adds to the problem is that accession is final, irrevocable and does not require a plebiscite or any taking of the wishes of the people. This uniformity in situation was for everyone. Bhawalpur in Pakistan had a Maharaja who acceded to Pakistan. Lahore had a huge population of Hindu people and there was a migration from Pakistan to India and vice versa. 

Moreover, when Nehru went to put the issue in front of the UN, he did not take the advice of his caninet, making the process illegal from the POV of the Indian state. Eventually (if this govt. has the brains), the GOI will declare the petition to the UN as illegal and withdraw it. 

That is my perspective on the whole ""plebiscite, aazadi"" issue. 

> Autonomy of Kashmir was eroded since '57. Pro-Indian politicians were shown their place time and again throughout the political timeline of Kashmir. You can Google that it is nothing new this time.

Yes no doubt the autonomy has been eroded. But also look at it in the the context of other states in India which did not have as much autonomy to begin with. 

The fundamental issue is that one nation cannot have 2 flags, 2 prime ministers, 2 constitutions, etc. It has to be uniform. That doesn't justify how the autonomy was erorded, but there was never a question in the eyes of India that this would go on forever. Even if the constitution permits the different relationships b/w centre and state, it is practically headed towards uniformity. 

In fact, when the reorganization bill took place in Parliament, it was as a resolution to support the reorganization of J&K. The actual act of removing Article 370 was done by a Presidential order. No parliament was required to remove Article 370. The only reason they had the parliament session was to justify the political support for such a move. 

> What happened in 1990s- Pandit exodus is a blot on our Kashmiri society, it was partly orchestrated by govt of the day, partly induced through threat and intimidation by KMs, KMs to an extent failed them. However, another non-muslim minority-Sikhs never left, ask yourself, why? Kashmiri Sikhs have always been there when KMs needed them, always. We are forever indebted to them.

""orchestrated by govt of the day"" - doubt that. Who kicked them out? Was it Indian soldiers? 

Those who are born today, cannot be blamed for what happened in the past. However, to say Minority A fled, but Minority B did not flee so it's not our fault is a pathetic argument. When the Anti-Sikh riots took place, why were Muslims not killed? It's the same logic. 

> The thing with Kashmir is that Kashmiri voices get lost between the din of propaganda on both the sides. We are like you, we have families and friends, we don't want to lose our loved ones to violence. You people get agitated when you Uber is late imagine our state, it has been 30 days and we have no news from our home.

By and large, I think people in India sympathize with that sentiment that people have suffered from violence. There should also be an understanding that the average person in India will never tolerate violent separatism especially when there are tones like ""Nizam-e-Mustafa"" and all sorts of Islamic rhetoric. We made Pakistan for those who did not want to live in India. We have suffered also in the Mumbai bombings and all sorts of random violence (obviously, not to the extent that is seen in Kashmir). People do sympathize with the notion of restoring basic facilities/normalcy to the region, but there is a huge dislike and non-tolerance for radical and violent Islamic movements, which is what a part of the separatist movement espouses. 

> I wonder how sub-continent would have been had there been no Kashmir issue since both India and Pak are spending millions on Kashmir that money would have ushered new development in our part of the world. As Orwell said, the war is never meant to be won it is only meant to be continuous.

Fundamentally, India and Pakistan cannot really co-exist acknowledging each other. One's existence puts a question mark upon the other. If Hindus and Muslims could live together, why would there be a need for a separate muslim country? If Hindus and Muslims cannot live together, then how come India still exists? 

The India/Pakistan question has been exacerbated in Kashmir because it is really the one place that disproves their 2-Nation theory so blatantly. A Muslim majority state in Hindu Majority India where there *was* a syncretic culture between all the religious groups living in harmony. Now, that's not as much anymore due to the radicalization. 

I feel that had it not been Kashmir, it would have been somewhere else (maybe UP or Gujarati muslims would have been the target focus group).

"Non-Indian here, can someone give a TLDR of what the political landscape of India is like?  Are there a lot of people (in government and public) in Malaysia who want him gone?. Not a death sentence, but looking at his direct involvement in radicalization of youth he should be looking at a life sentence.
But also considering the current situation of judiciary, his case might take many years before actually reaching to a conclusion. He might live a normal life outside jail while having a couple or may be dozen of court hearings a year. I would deport him to Syria [deleted] Terror attack in Bangladesh (neighbouring country) on communal grounds

Zakir Naik “inspired” the terror attack

Fled the country.

Whatever happens to him depends on the Judiciary. Indian Judiciary is strong and independent of the government.

The Pakistani 2008 26/11 terrorist was also given legal representation and a fair civil trial in open court. Despite the public outcry, the Judiciary ensured a fair trial.

If Zakir Naik has broken any law in India, he would be punished by the Judiciary under said law. He will be arrested .. he will be put through Indian justice system ,.. it will take years before there will be any verdict... very likely he will get life sentence ...  

But he also has supporters in politics circles (votes matter) ... if party who rules central government changes   ... there is a possibility he might get away with some light punishment 

It’s fake propaganda that he will be killed... chances of that happening is very slim ... we have people who wants to break this country roaming* free... He is banned by many other countries too. That should tell you something. 
Get that mofo out of your country asap. he will not get death sentence because he didn't raped a minor and killed them after or directly caused a terrorist attack that cost life. max he will get is 20 years and most probably get out in 10. In a way its good for india you guys have him because it will cause massive riots in india if he will go to jail. We don't want him back, keep him as long as you like or if you don't want to then send him to your neighbouring Singapore. No way will he be killed in India. He'll definitely not be sentenced to death because that's for the rarest of the rare and the type of crimes he's been charged with like Money laundering and maybe some charges of inciting terror wouldn't get him that punishment. Still, I'd much rather you guys keep him because him coming here will only incite more hatred between Indian religious groups here as his case goes on so I'd rather he stays away. If he is sent to India chances of him being dead is very less. He will be tried in court and the max that is gonna happen is life in prison, Im even doubtful that he would get life in prison. His crime is not eligible for death sentence. Hopefully he gets imprisoned in some other country cus Indian Judicial system is way too slow",AskIndia

I would beg to differ on your analysis though. What we are seeing as hindu muslim Christian radicalism is nothing but a farce pervaded by those in power to distract from the REAL issues that plague us all, namely declining quality of life, economic downturn and upcoming environmental crisis. 

As long as they can keep us fighting each other ov3r trivial and non consequential things like religion and caste, they can continue to be unanswerable for their blatant neglect or denial of the real issues at hand. Only if there something respectable about the old Hinduism. It was built on the caste system. Ambedkar having first hand experience of castiesm did try his best to fix but in the end he became a Buddhist. If the rss have time to learn about islam they should try to learn about castiesm too. You might find [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bzgq99/indias_right_to_cultural_selfdetermination/) interesting. Interesting article, very well written. Just curious, is this for an actual academic study? If so, you would need a lot more citations to get credibility. Puri book likh dali but fir bhi worth a read :)
Interesting to think about our history like this. Also people think of the right wing and the left wing in India as it is interpreted in the West, when irl it is so different. The ""bhakt"" ideology essentially finds most of its traction in northern and western India because of the reasons you mentioned. In east India (read Bengal) Islam didn't arrive by the sword, but by Arab traders and missionaries, like in Kerala. Some syncretism is also found in Islam in Bengal. West Bengal going the Hindutva way is an extremely recent phenomenon, and it's rather more due to political and lesser due to ideological reasons. In the northeast, the hate of Islam is not due to ""subjugation by foreign powers"" but more due to immigration. Because for the Northeasterners Muslim = Bangladeshi = illegal immigrant. Kerala seems to be free of Hindutva though, although the BJP isn't obviously happy with that. Islam was a fundamentally different religion. The dogmas and beliefs are based upon the words of the Prophet. With a span of few centuries, the entire middle East Asia became the hotbed of Islam. A similar penetration was seen in the northern part of the African continent. Several cities were pillaged and scores of documents were destroyed not only to distort history but to re-write the course of history in their own way. The fundamental problem of Islam is it's dogmas and beliefs which are still followed today. These dogmas have no place in today's world as they are impossible to follow and is against the moral values of the civil society. Rigidness of these dogmas are the cause of friction between Islam and other religions. The intolerance and hardcore views of the hardliners of both sides are attributed to the sense of being attacked by each other. It is not that both the religions aren't meant to co-exist along each other, it is the fear of being losing the religious identity which cause these friction between them. About Ambedkar's work on partition, there's no doubt that he makes an eloquent case for it and he has definitely convinced me about how partition was by far the best thing that could have happened for India. 

However, doesn't the logic of Ambedkar inexorably show that Kashmir valley should secede from India? If you're quoting him then I assume you're in broad agreement with his thoughts so what's your take on that?

PS- I've also read that a lot of the history that Ambedkar uses to buttress his logic is actually colonial history which isn't a very good take for what happened. The alternative view is Romila Thapar's where a division of Hindu period, Muslim period and British period (like Mill proposed) is the wrong lens to look at history from. This view helps support the logic where an unpartitioned India could have worked out. I'm not too sure that this is enough to falsify the great Ambedkar though, dude was extremely smart and would have known the inadequacies of the colonial communalised history and would have only used it because he desperately wanted partition to happen and this coloured take on events like Somnath would help sell partition to the Congress. s-senpai, it's too big",Non-Political

"[Rant] Criminalization of CSR is another pain for companies  I always feel CSR is unethical. Companies are paying tax and that is their social responsibilty and that is it. Now another 2% and than making it compulsory is just wrong. It like tax not paid to government over the tax paid directly to govt. Btw i am happy that you own a 500cr turnover company. [removed] This govt is making a big F mess of our economy... Also note that the government often leans on companies to provide funding for statues and other nonsense. I would just put a blanket provision in place saying all CSR funds go towards local government schools proportioned by number of employees of that company in a given location. You are correct. Companies should just be nationalized so that 100% of the work goes towards the community instead of the tiny % that goes towards CSR. All the points you stated about employment, wealth creation in the community, etc. will still be true and nobody will have to deal with such regulatory burdens. To be fair, the 'criminalisation' you refer to has always been there ever since it was introduced. CSR's non-compliance has always had (one of the) penalty as imprisonment. They haven't really changed the penal provisions with the amendment, just the enforcement strictness. From all practical perspective, (till now) non-compliance usually leads to compounding (basically a fine) and very very rarely leads to imprisonment (at least I'm not aware of any). I think from an enforcement perspective, they want to tighten things and make sure the companies are not just 'clicking pictures' and doing the CSR but are actually doing the work (or getting it done).

But you're right, the compliance officer might not be on the same page with respect to the CSR activities which can be troublesome to explain and (to show that he's doing his job and being strict n all), it may lead to unnecessary procedures and countless explanations. But then again, that's the thing with any compliance that is done in India. The finance minister is from JNU....................... Hello fellow 500 cr company stakeholder!

"West Bengal Doctors' Strike Updates  Pan-India strike on 17th June Similar incident happened at my college few years ago. Mob attack 2 surgical residents because of some CT Scan technical issue. Both of them were thrashed but recovered within a week a two. We protested for a week, our Dean and Medical Superintendent instead of sympathizing, told us to call it off because that would upset some caste. Fortunately, almost 80-90% of them got arrested. Security was uplifted but few weeks later it's still the same. If a mob were to attack today at the same place, I'm 100% sure they will be successful.

That's why I feel hopeless about the situation. These strikes will definitely make a huge impact but as long as these mobs are backed up by politicians, nothing can stop them. I am reading a lot of - doctors ""reject"" or ""refuse"" Mamta's plea, when it should be Mamta Banerjee ""refuses"" to show up at the hospital to provide reassurance to victim doctors and their families.

Mamta Banerjee further has shown no intent to walk to the doctors protesting in heat of Kolkata to listen to their concerns or take any action.

Mamta Banerjee, instead, has chosen this unfortunate event to demoralize, defame and threaten physician community, and to go further and play Hindu-Muslim politics.

Mamta Banerjee is solely responsible for not addressing physician concerns all over the country, originating in her own state, and letting entire state population suffer from limited healthcare services, and not taking blame for it.

Media is in dire need of education here on how to deliver facts!! Currently posted in Casualty. Had a close call last night. The patient was allegedly drunk and had an RTA. He came at 3.30 and we resuscitated with oxygen and suctioning his oral cavity. His SpO2 improved. We then called surgery and they came and saw. But the patient’s friend was a another drunk guy who called more of his friends. And then they started to record a video and they were shouting abuses at us. This happened when we had to shift the patient for a CT to rule out intracranial bleed. Scary shit. Very close to physically assaulting us. Is beating doctors a West Bengal thing or happens in other parts of the country as well? I am hearing it for the first time. Why would you beat someone trying to save lives? and the dumbass CM can go on political rallies but can't even visit the hospital where the incident took place. instead, she blames ""outsiders"" of instigating the movement. like seriously! you had a perfect opportunity to be the good guy and you blew it up bad. This is what happens when illiterate people are voted into power.

now she is like, come to Nabanna (the office of CM) and we will talk. The doctors responded: hell no, you come here. how difficult it is for her to just go to the hospital and assure protection? ego?

its high time we have an actual educational qualification requirement for politicians in India. Media and government is handling our situation really poorly. Media is only showing the protest and the ill effects it's causing but not the cause of our protest. I've seen no news channel yet disclosing the incidents which lead to this, I'm not talking about wb but many other incidents. I'll link one of them below and tell me if it is safe for any of the doctors to treat anyone.  https://medicaldialogues.in/no-stop-on-violence-gynecologist-beaten-with-rods-after-patient-dies-in-ccu/ Finally the WB govt agreed. 

Now the most important and most crucial step will be taken - Whether the promise is actually delivered. 

Just saying it will be done is not enough.  Loi bhi bolke ja sakta h.  It's important to see if it WILL be done. Many people are thinking that the Nationwide strike is politically motivated and that the doctors are actually controlled by a certain right wing party.

First off, are you even aware or are you just dumb enough to assume that everything in this country is political?!

The students and the interns first went on strike. Then the IMA came to support! IMA is independent of any political party! We doctors have enough on our plate to worry about already . 

The working conditions in most of the govt hospitals is basically shit, but we still, amidst all the hardships come there to treat everyone. 

The Govt needs to update its Healthcare policy seriously! It won't just get resolved by opening more colleges and providing Bridge course ( that's another bullcrap ) . It needs to be fixed from the ground! Better infrastructure and better security!

What the hell will you do if someone just comes and beats you up at your place of work for something that was totally out of your hand , even if you tried your best?! 

Will you be fucking going to political parties?

Most of the patients who blame the treatment or the doctors are themselves unaware. They go to their local 'docs ' who are actually most of the time quacks or from AYUSH and treat patients with their pseudo knowledge. Then when the conditions worsen, they come to the govt hospital? Why? Cheap treatment... 

We never turn away patients based on their religion or caste or any fucking thing else. We treat them as humans. They all are the same in front of us.

This provides meaning and order to society and is the only way to achieve progress and development. If you comply, you are allowed within the gambit of development, If not, you are treated as a rebel/outcast.

I wish there was more world-building and visible technological progress made in the show to give a more futuristic view of the dystopia.>! All technological progress seems to be exclusively made with regards to information technology in the aid of surveillance, holographic displays and virtual gas-chamber domes. One would think a more futuristic 2049 would have self-driving cars (within privileged Aryavarth sectors atleast), mixed traditional/futuristic fashion trends and so on. Lack of technological progress could be explained in future episodes possibility as a result of a war or other seismic events that caused most technology to be stuck in 2019. But it's not super convincing to me at least. !< A bit too gimmicky for my taste. Great and brave attempt. Butthurt Aryavrats have already filed case to ban it! The in your face-fuck you religion is going to harm Deepa Mehta in court now. Netflix will have to take it down in India. I'm 2 episodes in. The show does have some pacing issues and some minor nitpicks like set design. But that said, the story is interesting and I will watch it to see how it pans out. But not gonna binge it, and will probably finish watching the leftovers before I return to this. I just watched the trailer which looks good, even though the concept of a dystopian society has been tried and tested before. I'm just happy seeing all the right wingers, hindutva activists getting triggered. Just check the YouTube comments lmao. Kinda ironic that they complain all the time about radical Islam while ignoring the kind of shit minorities have to face due to the atrocities of Hindutva brigade in the last couple of years. A lot like the handmaid's tale ! I loved the show for the excellent world building. I can see so much of it playing out already. 

1. Water scarcity. That's a reality today itself and ""might is right"" will most likely be the way it will play out in future as it plays out now.

2. No access to ""doosh"". That was literally our history. The way we are trying to embrace everything from back in the days, this is almost a natural to be included in a world dictated by religious beliefs.

3. Mixed marriages being banned. Well, you do get the news of someone being killed by their family for inter-caste, inter-religion marriage. Dystopia is just reality amplified a few times. 

4. The gaping divide between the haves and not haves. It's just not as apparent to us as we live it everyday. It's ok for us to treat our helpers like shit. Nothing new shown here. It will only intensify in future as resources become more scarce. The poor will bear the brunt more than anyone.

It's already happening. We are already a society divided by caste and class. What the show portraits is what happens if you don't keep these tendencies under check. The comments section for the trailer on YouTube proves that it's not all that far out in future.

Rajiv Gandhi had once won 400seats. By this logic he also demolished caste arithmetic. But then we came back to the very same arithmetic

Truth is that BJP owns media outlets like ChuPublic and times wow who act like Modi's IT cell.

And no caste arithmetic has been destroyed. Ppl trust Modi. Dumb decision owing to 45yr high unemployment rate. But they did

Come next election if BJP IT cell aka ChuPublic tv works its magic then Modi might win again

But after he is gone. It'll be business as usual. Look what happened to AIADMK  ""Today Congress and the rest can complain about resources but in 2014 Congress was in power and Modi was an outsider and yet he won.""

If they can control his life just sitting here in India, this shit is seriously beyond repair and you would be better just moving on. You’re wasting your time, girl!!! He can never go back to India, he is 39 years old and yet he can’t stand up for himself. If you end up marrying him, you’ll also be married to strangers who live hundreds of kilometers away! They’ll control your life just like they control his! Move on... OP, he does has a lot to learn. And your anger and emotional turmoil is justified. But it is really up to him to take a stand. It is now or never. While I do understand that being an average Indian he wouldn't want to cross his parents but neither will he able to take a stand for you if his parents go bonkers.

"We need some Indian shows  Comedy shows about Indian politics are not easy because most people won’t accept critique of the party they support. There is a reason why the shows you’ve mentioned are on online platforms because the intended audience is young, educated people. TV pe sirf Kapil Sharma ke ghatiya jokes chalte hai. But yes, it’s a genre that is missing in India... If you want a political comedy then you can watch Consti-tution by NewsLaundry on YouTube. 

There's also Soch on YouTube. It's not a comedy but they've recently analysed electoral prospects of parties  in different states. Plenty of videos on social issues too.

Both of these are hosted by one guy talking at the camera.

Spooksandooks on Facebook is also brilliant. Animated videos about various Indian issues - like our geopolitical strategies, our economy etc

If you want shows where political personalities are interviewed then Akash Banerjee and Kunal Kamra are both good. We want Movers and Shakers back on tv. To be fair, we need more Tonight show hosts like Jimmy Fallon, or Jimmy Kimmel. They aren't just about interviewing Celebs, but also about providing info to the public about various things, and, of course, Political Satire.

I'd prefer someone like John Oliver, whose jokes are on the thin line that separates ""going too far"" and ""being too safe"", where if you're the person being joked about, you just have to sit down, clap your hands, and say, ""Bravo"".

I have no idea which Indian Personality has the merit/charisma to take on the Indian World on Live TV, though. Any person you know who could do wonders on such a stage? There was a political comedy show by a radio dj babua on zee tv. Don't know if it's still on. Watch it to fill your political satire needs. Or actually don't because it was fucking terrible. Give Kunal Kamra and Ramit Verma a show.! ""Nation knows what's up"" Check out 'Bharat Ek Mauj' hosted by Sanjay Rajoura on youtube.  
Also, check out 'Aisi taisi democracy', which is a live comedy satire show done by Rahul Ram, Varun grover and Sanjay Rajoura  
If you want little more comedy and memes, checkout 'Yeh sab kya ho raha hai!"" on SnG Comdedy's youtube channel. Not happening in this country... People are very volatile here, I don't think anyone will openly criticize a politician, it's risky for themselves.

Edit: Hasan criticizes trump and Hilary openly, just imagine him in India... Don't think he will call out names, and if he did he will shipped to Pakistan since he is Muslim... India is like a quasi-theocracy today. Modi is a god to tens of millions of retards. Creating a good quality satirical show like Patriot Act or Last Week Tonight or Full Frontal With Samantha Bee isn't the challenge. There's an ocean of creative talent in India. The challenge is the kind of response such a show would elicit from a very easily offended audience. 

Donald Trump is the world's most powerful man, but not a day goes by without a comedian or even members of the general public casually using the worst possible abuses for him on national television and other media platforms.

That, as screwed up as it may be at the moment, is a true democratic country. 

Try doing that in India and the countdown to your inevitable lynching (at worst) or your public demonization with potentially scary fallout on your personal/professional life (at best) begins immediately. I read research on that most comedy satire based shows are left wing and the reasoning for that is, well, something along the lines of left wing people are more open to criticism in general etc. That is probably why we see so many satirical shows based in USA, like last week tonight, patriot act, stephen colbert and so many more and all of them are left wing.

Maybe the reason why India doesnt have a show like that is because India is more right wing? On a side note: I feel like Indian reality shows need a major revamp. Majority of them(especially the singing and dancing ones) look very fake that’s it’s almost hard to watch them",Non-Political
"How often do your corporate bosses call you on your personal cell phone for daily work and what times of the day? How often do you respond to their calls and oblige their work requests (strictly non-urgent ones) ?  >TLDR; Bosses call up employees post-work hours regularly even for inane tasks (compounded by the laptops which allows them free rein to demand online presence for immediate last-minute changes) - Is this all too common around the world / India or is the company culture at my firm just plain bad vis-à-vis most others ?

​Pretty common, in most companies in India which allow work from home. 

If you want to avoid this especially for inane tasks the best thing to do is to just avoid calls from the office after office hours. 

The downside of doing this would be that you are going to be considered someone who is not doing enough to get work done my chutiya boss at honeywell has created whatsapp group and send sunday night notification to attand meetup at morning 8am. i told him,  i posted in his group that,  i have muted this group and dont check message frequently. TLDR buddy. The calling at off office hours isn't a new thing for India. When there were no laptops, people were called to come to office. 

MNC companies have lesser issue than Indian ones. But major factor is the job role. 

If you work in B2B segment and you have client connect roles like consulting then this is frequent - strategy consulting, law, HR, IT, Corporate banking, etc.

Switch off the office phone between 9pm to 9am and on weekends and holidays. Your boss will try a few times then give up. Wife has separate work and personal sim cards. Turns off the work sim the moment she leaves office. Worked well for her so far. There is always another person in the office to whom this urgent job can be assigned when the wife isn't reachable.

"People of r/india, help a complete stranger out with career advice [R]eddiquette  I honestly don't understand how forcing a child to do what you think has more money, will make the child happy?

From my experience, I will say that please, only do a Masters in something, if you're genuinely interested and motivated to pursue that subject. You don't just go to an institute, get a degree and then are inundated with buttloads of money. It's hard work. You are developing a finer specialization in a field. And if you're are genuinely not motivated, it can end terribly.

The most important thing right now for you, I think, is to carefully think which profession you want to get in. Money is an important criterion, but I think the 3 fields you mention, they all pay well and sufficient for you to live comfortably. The most crucial question is: what work do you enjoy? What do you see yourself doing for years, day in and day out? Sometimes you will be thinking about work during your free time. Which of those 3, Graphic Design, MBA and Civil, do you see yourself giving your all? Something that you can work on, for hours and hours?

My background: I went into engineering, against my father's wishes. He wanted me to go into medical, and I sucked in that. You can imagine the drama that ensued because of my decision. He was threatening to disown me. The whole Indian TV soap drama.

Then I went abroad for Masters in Theoretical Physics. This was something that developed gradually. I kept asking ""why?"" to engineering questions, delved deeper and deeper, and got hooked on Modern Physics. I naturally wanted to do a PhD, and got a scholarship for that. Now I have a good job abroad. It's not all rainbows and roses. Some days are really damn hard and it's a pain to get through the work. But at the end of the day, I am still grateful I took this path, made my own decisions, and live the consequences.

This is your life. You are the one who will actually have to do the work. Your parents/uncles/aunties/friends *might* think that this is better for you or that.

Understand that civil and criminal defamation are the same thing in essence;  civil defamation is a concept under tort law; which in India is not codified, meaning there is no Act or written rule for torts but  criminal defamation falls under S 499 of the IPC which is a codified law.

The main difference between Civil & Criminal proceeding for defamation is pertaining to compensation. While the object of Civil action is to adequately compensate the person defamed for the loss of reputation by damages; the object of Criminal prosecution is to punish the offender by way of imprisonment of fine or both.

Personally UPSC is a bitch and will take the exam on 31st.

Pending interviews: I’m glad I’m done, but pre wont wait for the deferred interviews There's a 90% chance that UPSC will postpone prelims. Can't say the same about the interviews.

All the major centres such as Mumbai, Pune, Delhi, Indore etc are going to be under some form of restriction even till mid-May easily with the intensity of rising cases(if not 100% lockdown).

Public transport might not be 100% available at the time of exam,  (buses or trains at least)

Some states such as Telangana have increased their lockdown to even 7th May.

And since the decision is to be taken around 3rd or 4th May(for an exam of this scale, they have to inform people well in advance), by that time, most restrictions would be there in place anyway so high probability of prelims getting postponed.

Going by the manner in which they're postponing even the notifications for various exams such as Medical services, CAPF etc they too are deliberating for a new date for the exams.

For interviews, they may be conducted within a fortnight of travel restrictions lifting as they don't require mass assembly/movement of people. I think they’ll delay. Any past record of the commission has little importance because these are unprecedented circumstances. My wife is giving exam this year. 

It is almost conformed to be delayed. It would not likely be in May as it is a manual intensive pen & paper exam which is human resource intensive. Expected date is July as per their study circle. I think they'll delay. Can't say for sure. Make sure to check the website daily.

>

Increasingly, this is proving to be bad advice (even though it is WHO-supplied), and face masks are shown to reduce transmission. Doesn't have to be N95, even a cloth or handkerchief will help.

> S. Wearing masks outside the home in a reference period corresponding to the 2 weeks before symptom onset for cases was significantly protective against clinical SARS. Supporting the validity of this finding, there was a dose-response effect: by multivariable analysis, persons who always wore masks had a 70% lower risk of being diagnosed with clinical SARS compared with those who never wore masks, and persons with intermittent mask use had a 60% lower risk. Many persons who wore masks in the community did not use N-95 or similar highly efficient filtration devices, which have been recommended for use in the hospital setting.

Gift the couple with FD. Profit . The situation is going to deteriorate significantly in my opinion. It'll be very risky for you and your guests. Just say April fool to everyone 🤷
Just have a normal family celebration Im afraid april will bring out the worst Be the first official e wedding. Send everyone live facebook/youtube link of your wedding. If you have money, send everyone a memoribilia through courier. Fucking canc it already. Even only family would be a large gathering .. what with travel restrictions and all... Better to postpone Hey, so my wedding was in a week and we postponed it to whenever things have settled down a bit. Having been through the mess that is making this decision, these are my two cents: 1. Realise that older people and family will insist on attending this wedding because it’s family and shaadi and what not. If they do end up coming or you end up travelling, realise the risk you are putting yourselves and most importantly the older people in the family. Ask yourself if you want this wedding to be probably remembered as the one where a bunch of people caught the virus (hoping that doesn’t happen); 2. If the couple want a smaller wedding and that is a possibility, then do that. Just very close family or just a registered wedding with a reception later when this shit has calmed down; 3. While the family may have put in a lot of effort into planning this wedding and having a big bash, understand that these are extraordinary circumstances and everyone needs to step back and realise that things will not work as planned. We agreed to wait for a few months and if the situation doesn’t improve by then we will probably have a small ceremony and move on with our lives. It’s a very hard decision but for us the fact that we didn’t want to put anyone in danger especially the older guests and our parents took precedence. Good luck and stay safe! You have to cancel it mate. It's only going to get worse from here. Covid-19 isn't going anytime soon. India may well be at the start of the peak that is yet to come. Even conservative estimates put at least 30 crore getting infected in the next 2-3 months. Even with a 0.1% mortality rate(actual is 20x that), it is a grim grim 2020 summer we are looking at.

I think your guests and relatives will understand if you cancel the wedding. And even if you won't, the government sure as shit won't let a mass gathering happen at a time when fatalities would have surely increased.

(I have close relative whose wedding is getting cancelled too. And most people understand why.) Also for additional info, we are in mumbai and the bride is in Rajasthan, so even a family affair seems highly doubtful.

"Appreciation to Maharashtra Government  Let me explain why \*I think\* these are incorrect numbers:

Because you are comparing with the countries in west, let me tell you that those numbers are based on extensive testing on people. So if people show symptoms like cough, fever, cold, they get tested for this virus along with others. Which is why there are many positive cases in west.

Now in India, ask how many of people who have the above symptoms have got tested for this virus. Or even went to the Doctor? The less you test, the less the numbers you will get. The countries in west are already in under almost total lockdown, yet the numbers are increasing (due to the high R0 of the virus). While in India, we still have many major companies & businesses operating in full-capacity mode, big crowded markets in Mumbai still open like almost every day.  There is no point in shutting down the schools & keeping kids at home if their parents are going to work everyday in Mumbai locals & coming back home. There is absolutely no reason yet to believe that the virus hasn't really spread or the number of real infected persons are that low.

As a human first & Indian second, I really do hope that we do somehow have low numbers & we are doing a real good job. This could be one example where India could standout strong among other major countries once this is all over. But right now, it is too early to say that we are in a better position than other countries. Hi I'd like to say that I work in Healthcare in one of the biggest companies in India and even though the govt is trying to do a good job which is commendable, they've been lying about the numbers.

"[AskIndia] Fathers/mothers of Reddit India, what were the 38-41 weeks of pregnancy like for you? Long post ahead.  OP, post this in r/TWOXINDIA as well. https://www.babycenter.com/childbirth-class has all you need to know about child birth. Regarding centers,city,hospital, I don’t know. India C section is becoming very much the de facto option which is sad malpractice by doctors. Most cases natural birth is possible without much medication. 3 of my kids were natural born without any medication. 4th one (actually our 2nd) she took epidural. 1. Depends on the risk factors. High risk pregnancies require weekly monitoring. Otherwise bi monthly suffice.
2. 3 is average and is by no means overweight.   
3. Cervical examination is done to check how much the cervix has dilated. I was checked every hour when I went in while in labor (about 3-4 times). Ended up with a emergency c section as large baby + baby in distress.
4. Any bleeding in late term, even if it's due to cervical examination needs to be monitored. Unless the doctor did a membrane sweep, there shouldnt really be a bleeding but then again depends on sensitivity I guess.
5. I had a cervical check a day prior to my labor (I was at week 39 and very close to my due date) and I had no bleeding but went into labor naturally much later at night. I woke up with back pain after midnight and I just knew this was it. Went to the loo, water broke, told my husband it was time and then woke up my parents. Waddled to hospital 2 hours later after I timed my contractions and knew they were getting a min apart. 
6. High risk and multiples. Also Indian doctors love inducing women even when they are in labor to reduce the labor time which makes it much harder on the women (I was induced despite being in labor already and the pain shot through the roof).
7. Only large hospitals can administer pain relief for vaginal birth as most hospitals in india don't have monitoring systems in place to check for contractions and tell the woman to push. 
8. None. I was birthing at my home town. So I chose the one which had a sensible doc that would listen to me and not swat my concerns as ""google"" led. Look up water birthing, think there's one in Kerala but I'm of the ""give birth in hospital"" opinion as I don't know how equipped these centers are to handle post natal and intensive care for babies.

I can understand your dilemma. My only advice is that before you take any major steps like quitting, may be just give it a try to talk to your boss. 

From what you wrote it looks like he is a reasonable guy so may be  ask him for an unofficial coffee meeting and just calmly explains everything that you wrote here. But in a more businessy way (with concrete points, facts and numbers). For example: think from his perspective, he is the CEO of a start-up so the company's success hangs on his shoulder. You need to show him that you can do equally good or even better job in the 6 day week and contribute effectively in the company's growth. 

If its ok, you can also offer him a little reduction in your pay against one day off. Otherwise if he still disagrees try asking for alternatives, like home office or any other weekday off (where one of your colleagues can support if urgent).

No industry no matter which branch does not need to work round the clock. Even employees of emergency services like 911 work in shifts. So the expectation from company is unrealistic and by not hiring an additional resource they are just trying to save money. 

Nonetheless, if they really appreciate you and value your work they should agree to make little adjustments to keep you happy and productive. And if nothing else work then go ahead and quit.

If you want to play this game then as per Ayurveda the best quality of sleep is when you will sleep 9-10 PM, 9 pm to 2 am is the best quality of sleep, Even if you sleep after 2 am to 12 noon, You won't get that quality of sleep or that satisfaction.

That's how our body's bio clock works, Our body works in sync with Nature, we keep on altering it. Try sleeping between 9 to 10 pm, Withing 2-3 weeks you will notice that your sleeping quantity (hours) will decrease by the sleep quality will increase or get better.

Keep your electronics aside 1 hour before your bedtime, Mediate for 15 minutes if you can, Your body will enter Theta state, from that you can easily slip into Delta i.e. Deep Sleep. Don't eat heavy meals at night moreover avoid eating after 7 pm if you can

"What kind of a doctor or treatment do I seek for Sleep Disorder?  Try having melatonin pills just an hour before you intend to sleep. If that doesn't works, consult a doctor. Our sleep is dependent on Melatonin. And Melatonin depends on light. In natural conditions (no artificial light), Melatonin starts rising after 19:30/20:00 and peaks in the middle of the night (~ 03:00) and goes down by 07:30/08:00. [Note that the level rises over 7 hours but goes down in 4/5 hours.] As the level starts rising we start feeling sleepy. 

This is a natural cycle, which we can vary but this is something that is deeply encoded within us. We ideally shouldn't mess with this and neither mess by taking Melatonin Pills.

Another factor is the Deep Sleep/Rapid Eye Movement cycles which adapt based on your sleep duration. 

Based on the above factors and disregarding ideal conditions, this is the ideal sleep pattern:
1. The middle of the night (~ 03:00) should coincide with the middle of your sleep. 
2. Your waking time should not vary by more than half an hour, the sleeping time has more flexibility. Changing the waking time messes the Deep Sleep / REM Cycle. 

As an example, taking 6 hours of sleep, 00:00 - 06:00 is the best. For a good, 7/8 hours sleep, 23:00 - 07:00 / 22:30 - 07:00 would be the best. 


Consider the further as a Tl;dr: 

Now coming to your exact problem, if you want to solve your problem in a proper way, you need to have patience and take appropriate steps.

Decide a time you want to sleep and limit light in your environment, 2-3 hours prior with a special focus on screen brightness, filters etc. Then at your decided time, switch off the lights, switch off all screens. (If you aren't feeling sleepy, you can listen to music, even listen to movies/TV Shows/ Audio Books etc. Remember, Light is the priority.) Then no matter when you fall asleep, decide a time and get up at that moment. 

Then, during the day, do not take more than 30-45 minutes nap in the afternoon, fight off the sleep (not by OD'ing on Caffeine). Automatically, you will feel sleepy earlier the next night.

This will cause discomfort for a few days but within a few days (if everything is done right, less than a week) you will have a new sleep cycle. 
Point in favor, People who live for months in a different time zone, get over Jet Lag and get acclimatized in a few days. You cannot change your sleeping patterns overnight. Take baby steps, try sleeping at 3AM first and do that for a couple of weeks, then change it 2 and so on until you reach your desired goal. Make sure you tire yourself throughout the day, exercise, go to the gym, run, do anything than be idle all day. Go to a psychiatrist first. They'll try to find the root cause and refer you accordingly. Supplement glycine and magnesium. Use magnesium in form of magnesium citrate or magnesium glycinate. 

Take 400 mg magnesium daily with dinner and 3-5 gran glycine daily at night.

"Can Indians grow a spine already?  I think bigger underlying issue is the idea of life isn't complete or you are not settled till the time you are married. I could be earning, financially and emotionally independent but for Indian parents marriage is end all be all to every existence. More urban parents are getting sort of okay with love or ""love-arranged"" but none is okay with idea of NO marriage. 
And standing up to them is like death with thousand cuts. It starts eroding your conscience.  arranged marriages give way to dysfunctional families but I have seen non arranged marriages being dysfunctional as well. As dysfunctional people attract each other that type of thing. #The average guys *wishes* he would find love. Counterpoint: Dating in India is dominated by players, scammers, blackmailers and entitled ones who throw acid if they dont get what they want. There is no place for civility here.

tl;dr: Dating in India is asking for trouble. [deleted] Arranged marriages are the only reason why some men in our country get a woman to marry them. Yeah, grow a spine and like and do as one likes. There is no need that only 1 way is correct.

&#x200B;

I went for arranged marriage as there are many factors in place for me.  If one loves someone he can do love marriage, some one likes live-in. Do it.

In any case, anything can happen. People get depressed after love marriage also.

&#x200B;

And I personally don't think that it's the case of who one can blame after things go south. . Becoming an adult means that you can make a decision and you have to live with it. Dating is risky in india..only safe dating options are in college or workplace. Lot of scamners out there. Arranged marriage is the only route  for people not finding a match at these places..these days most profiles on matrimonial sites are managed by girls only so i dont see how it is any different from any other dating app.regarding courtship  3 years is a bit too much time to understand and then reject a person especially if you are nearing your 30s. Most Indian guys lack the social skills and/or social capital to get into relationships. There's also the skewed ratio at work here, coupled with the fact that girls are highly and in some cases violently discouraged from being in relationships. I'd say it's a cultural flaw - arranged marriages have been the norm for centuries, we never developed the social skills to maintain romantic relationships before marriage. The majority, which either doesn't know how to talk to the opposite sex, or can't, has only one chance at a relationship - through Arranged Marriage. Which is a hit or miss, with no way to undo what has been done. Can Indians grow a spine, or do you lack the said object yourself op? Seems like a big whine. 
If you have a problem with arranged marriages, just don't do one. People don't usually date in small towns and villages. And they have their right to remain a virgin before marriage.

"Why the Supreme Court’s verdict on SC/ST quotas has created a political storm | It has upheld the state’s powers to deny reservations to Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe communities.  Muslims and reservation are two distractions used by Indian elites to confuse people. These two are blamed for all of India's problems and people are stupid enough to believe it. 




Honestly, as a dalit I sometimes wish let them remove reservation. Then let them explain to masses how 1% Indians are getting 73% Indian wealth. Within decade there will be riots in streets and true people responsible for Indian poverty will be found out. Sizable dalit tribal population doesn't understand how system is rigged against them, they think reservation is making some difference. These guys can finally wake up. You have 22.5% reservation for 29% SC,ST in government jobs which are just 4% of total jobs. And people think this is useful or something. The main question we need to ask is where are the damn jobs ? I have said previously that Scheduled Castes and Tribes are next on the list after Muslims.

Looks like I was wrong. They're targeting everyone at the same time, just with a different approach. >The other problem is also the court’s selective affirmation of the state’s discretionary powers for providing reservations. When it comes to a decision not to provide reservations, the court feels the state has absolute discretion and need not collect data to justify this decision. But when the state wants to provide quotas, the court brings in the concept of equality and places several restrictions that dilute the discretionary power of the state. The 50% ceiling for quotas is an example of this restriction.


This alone is enough to show how the SUPREME COURT is disingenuous and biased as hell and their end goal isn't equality of any sorts. First they stopped making it compulsory for promotion in government jobs and now will give only lower level jobs to reservations.
Second they stopped compulsory arrest in SC/St act and will give pree arrest anticipatory bail to the accused.

This is the destruction of the act itself. 

Bc reservation is not the government spooge to give its a bloody constitutional right. Get that modi shah I wish the govt does try fucking around with the reservations. I truly pray that they somehow think that by making their stooges pass such judgements that they can alter the basic tenets of reservations and try curtailing it. It will be the end of this govt. Period. Come on BJP/RSS! Try messing with reservations. Please. You can do it!! Show us how tough you are. First Moslems , now SC/ST ; good job BJP judiciary /govt . Golly what is with this government? Talk to upper caste, and they believe BJP is shit and giving SC/ST everything. Talk to SC/ST, they say its upper caste party

Who the fuck voted for these mfs? I believe reservations  should be based on economic conditions and not on caste.
The reason is many sc's and st's have a high family income yet take advantage of reservation.
On the other hand there are many general candidates that have very low family income yet have no such advantage.

Reservations(if any) should be used to lift the distressed classes and not lift the already uplifted.",Politics

Would you eat this? Perhaps if you were starving and nothing else was available to you? That is why these people started eating them! [removed] I’m not telling everyone to eat non-veg, beef or pork. I know the last two are unfathomable for most of us. However, those that want to eat them should have no restrictions. There never used to be any such laws before and this was the traditional diet of many communities Gai doodh nahi deti hai, hum usse le lete hai. Spot on. It's not like we are an animal or nature-loving society otherwise. It's all caste, masquerading as lifestyle choices. I belong to small backwards village in UP where we didn’t have electricity until a few years ago

Outside our village was a basti of the Chamars

They certainly did not eat lithi chokha unless it was given to them as leftovers. All they were entitled to eat was the leftovers of higher castes and they used to take the joothan of both Hindus and Muslims without discrimination. I am haunted by a moment when I was around 10 years old and ran after the ice cream cycle and bought an ice cream and I was greedily eating it like a pig while a boy the same age as me but from the Chamar community was staring at the ice cream and at me and I still remember the look on his father’s face. His father wanted to buy one for his son as well and went after the ice cream man. My mother told me to eat it away from them so that they cannot see and ‘najar nahi lagegi’ 

They ate pig and breed them and would sacrifice a pig every year to their caste god. They also ate the flesh of all dead animals. They ate lizards, jackals, mongoose I don't get the cow fascination most cows are domesticated so they grow up for sole purpose of feeding milk to the population so why get offended when people eat it I mean the cow served same purpose in both cases to feed people, I will never get the cow thing it's so stupid. 
My great grandfather(Brahmin) moved to West Bengal and since then most of our family members are non vegetarians but still beef is very sensitive topic. I hope someday we can see through this bs it's a domesticated animal people stop getting offended. I am sorry but you are using the words ""Indian"" and ""caste"" very vaguely. I am an upper caste Brahmin from the Bengal originally and there is no such restriction for any caste. In fact even the ""pujari"" eats non veg after doing puja, in fact he is fed before everyone else can eat. Also, same is the case in kashmiri shaivism and a lot of other tantric sects as well. 

It is only a few ""elitist"" brahmins (mostly vaishnavites). Who promote such ideas and should be looked down upon because they spoil the name of Hinduism. We are a very vast culture with many schools of thought we can't demean Hinduism entirely just because a part of it is very casteist. We need to learn, re-write and re-narrate Hinduism to the masses.

"ok lets have some serious talk  A 13 year old won't have probably faced any situation or exam in which reservation matters. So its probably some prejudice or some family member speaking through his mouth. 

Best way to look at or judge something is by being detached from your identity of sc ,st ,general  obc,black, white. This is what arjuna did on the battlefield. Kid , what about working hard for rest  (100-22.5)% seats ? Hello fellow 13 year old. Don't worry about your writing.

Understand that most of your opinions are based around the views of your family at such a young developing age. The reservation system was created and exists for a reason which is to uplift backward castes.

However, it is widely misused. People who benefit from such reservation are not poor desperate people and can be economically better than people from the general category.

The hatred towards reserved categories are based around the reservation system but also are imbibed in the caste system and the aspects of untouchability which exist till date.

To abolish the reservation system or to change it in such a way that only those who can't afford education economically benefit from it, would take a lot of work and eventually abolition of castes.

Study the system if you have a problem with it and change it as you grow up. Since you want a serious talk, let me put the question straight to you. Who will bell the cat? I agree that the reservation system in India is skewed. I felt its heat when I was a teenager. After all, I am an upper caste. But we can talk about it next. The cat here is the upper caste. How does one make the upper caste not discriminate? Casteism is a disease that propagates from one generation to the next. It is this disease in upper-caste that made them SC, just two letters. I never saw anyone write UC to denote Upper Caste but we write SC without a second thought. How would you convince the upper caste to give up this disease? The reservation system is bad medicine to eradicate this disease. I agree. But do you have any other solution for this disease? In India only 2% of the jobs are government jobs and out of that 2% only 22.5% are reserved for the SCs and STs,  the rest 77.5% are still up for grabs for other communities. Since you are a kid, it would idiotic of me to expect you to have a lot of 'verified' knowledge as most of your current knowledge most probably is hear say. The thing is that the discrimination is not a result of reservations rather it is a cause of it. Reasons for having reservations are many and some people have already pointed them out to you like the 'affirmative action'. The other most important reason is to increase the representation of SCs and STs in the higher levels of decision-making. And do one thing Google this ""Crimes against Dalits in 2019"" and see what percent of those are due to reservation related hate(I reckon it would be nil). Be informed. You need to read about Supreme Court's judgement on this matter

Reservations are affirmative action to counter caste based discrimination Better argument should be, when can we end it or will reservation ever end.   

Let's focus on that, what can be the conditions or position when reached we can remove reservations. This will give us better view of the current situation and what we expect from our future. Simple. Ask Govt to abolish all castes. Then there is no reservation needed. Are you fine with that? You can't make an assumption about a country of 1.3 billion population.
I live in a rural area and yes there are discrimination still exists, they are still poor, but slowly making progress/growth.
I have seen these twitter trolls comes up with the picture of a guy cleaning gutters and write, are brahmins/generals going to do this?
Which is out of reasoning and bullshit, first of all if today you go to a people of sc caste and tell him you need to clean the gutters as you belong to the SC caste, he will slap you and kick you out of there.
Also people thinks generals are all rich and have no lack of resources is also false, general caste people are also poor, jobless, lives in poverty.
You can not just take away the reservation system in India, no one can, even this bjp govt. which everyone believe is anti minority couldn't take away the existing reservation but they brought 10% for general caste people and tried to balance things out.
Unfortunately India is going to suffer with the caste system for foreseeable future, and even if someone try to do something about it, politicians won't let this happen for their own benefit.

And for the common people,before you stand up for your caste/peoples and try to involve in internet arguments, have a look around where you live, I can guarantee there isn't one place in our country where people of only one caste are suffering from poverty. pls don't hate we have the right to equality 99% of the jobs in this country don't have reservations.

"ADHD medication in India  Schedule H.

Schedule H drugs cannot be sold over the counter without providing some sort of prescription. You can get one from your doctor in the United States, or you can visit a local doctor in Bangalore, but if it's a local doctor, make sure it's at a reputable hospital or something. Get a copy of your prescription from your doctor in the US. Show the prescription to a pharmacist. If you are trying to get ritalin you might need a Indian doctor to sign off also.

Best of luck. My understanding is that the only way to get Methylphenidate in Bangalore is to go to NIMHANS for a prescription, and also purchase your meds from there. Methylphenidate is otherwise not available at almost any medical store, and hence psychiatrists outside NIMHANS don't prescribe it either. 

This isn't first hand information, hence I am not entirely certain about this. But I have ADD/EFD and this is what I remember from my research about medication options available in India, and Bangalore specifically. Also, I researched this 4-5 years ago, so this information could well be outdated.

Atomoxetine and Modafinil are the only relevant meds available in India, with Methylphenidate being highly regulated, and everything else entirely banned.

"Trains availability and schedule flexibility  Travelling in trains in India on non-reserved tickets is not something you would want to do. 

There's only about a month left so you better hurry and book your tickets on www.irctc.co.in otherwise you would not even get a reserved ticket.

To have a better idea about what type of tickets to book, search for 'What does 1A, 2A, 3A, SL, CC, 2S mean in Indian trains'. I would recommend you to book 3AC tickets.

Edit: You can book tickets 1 day before train's departure day under Tatkal quota too but it's risky and its costs extra money. Tickets can be sold out in under 5 minutes after it opens. You will get tickets easily even in Tatkal a day before while you are travelling Kanpur to Varanasi and Varanasi to Kolkata. 
I always used to take tickets a day before while I was living in Kolkata and coming to Varanasi my hometown. 

One of my friend used to stay in Kanpur and I often used to visit it in the same manner. .

If nothing is planned and you want a flexible journey, then you can do tickets a day before but be a little cautious and do it as soon as ticket booking opens, which is 10 a.m for A.c class and 11 a.m for sleeper class.  I would suggest you to book confirm ticket now, if it is available. You can cancel it later, if there is a change of plan and book a Tatkal ticket. 

You can text me if you want more information about the places to visit or any help or have any confusion regarding these cities. Get the NTES app on your phone for live train status. It's the official app and it's good. Do you have a non Indian passport ? Foreigners have a quota in most major trains and you can purchase reserved tickets under this category from major train stations like New Delhi Railway station. It might be difficult to find seats in regular category on trains if you use the online route as trains get booked fairly in advance. Goodluck !

"Will India (and our highly questionable work culture) benefit from a 4 days working \ 3 days weekly off schedule?  The single biggest minus point about Indian society is the non-existence of clear communication and lack of transparency and accountability in dealing with things.  

Such being the case, the 4 hour workday won't work because that kind of productivity requires an enormous amount of clarity with the undestanding that the everyone involved is working hard to get the job done. Japan and India are two entirely different animals.

Japan has an ageing workforce. It also has a work environment that emphasises employees working long hours. The stress had in recent times resulted in multiple news reports of employees committing suicide which had prompted a national outcry and condemnation.

In addition to this, the work-nolife balance also resulted in men and women choosing to marry late or choosing to delay having children. This isn't good considering the already low population growth rate in the country. This has even led to the mechanisation of many low end jobs in Japan because they can't find enough people to work.

So a 4 day work week might work in a country like Japan which is carrying out iniatives in order to promote population growth. The 4 day work week has a high synergy with these objectives.

India meanwhile has a high population growth, high unemployment and a young workforce. The competition here has prompted firms to cut costs in order to maintain profit. This often means a smaller workforce, which still does the same amount of work by taking longer hours; but without any commiserate increase in remuneration. 

Even when an employee is burned out, the rat race in India is so bad that there is always an enormous pool of often unemployed/underemployed applicants who are ready to be hired at short notice for a lower pay. So the employers can simply choose to fire the burned out employees and hire new recruits to keep the assembly line at work.

Long story short: In Japan, employees are still a key human resource. In India, they are an expendable tool. Many times we have to work on weekends anyways. Can't think why that will change. And it won't matter if your clients work 5 days a week. Your opinion doesn't matter. [The decision has already been made](https://www.livemint.com/news/india/govt-avoids-fixing-minimum-wage-in-draft-rules-suggests-9-hour-working-day-11572758439316.html).

> The Indian government has suggested a nine-hour normal working day in its draft wage code rules, but has stayed away from fixing a [national minimum wage](https://www.livemint.com/news/india/why-minimum-wage-won-t-fix-india-s-woes-1565619815429.html). 

> 26 days of work in a month

Which basically means 6 days a week.

So yeah, go fuck yourself. The Government has already decided 6 days a week, 9 hours a day for everybody. Bhai middle managers won't let this happen. Mandated 5 day work week would be a start. Apart from MNCs and few central government offices, everyone else works on Saturdays. also what would be the secondary effects of this move - as participation in hobbies, skill growth, lower commute \ traffic congestion - shall all have largely stimulating advantages in the overall environment. 

I am fascinated by what the results of such an experiment will be if implemented on a controlled, small scale. I think India would better benefit from more Work-from-home options. For example, come to office twice a week and wfh other days, especially in congested cities like bangalore. Now even Saturday and Sunday leave is a problem. Either you have to work om weekends due to some emergency or they load you with so much work and such deadlines that you end up working on weekend. If we deny the manager will say even we went through this or we will be simply released as there will be 1000s ready to work on saturday and sunday. Talk about negative competition. population (s)explosion That's like taking 3 steps at a time. First jobs need to be 6-8 hours long 6 days a week. Generally people are given ""work from home"" even on Sundays. Not to mention people work till 8 when they were supposed to be home by 5 or 6pm.

You need to go out, talk to a lot of people in the space, cultivate useful contacts, fish for opportunities, market yourself, etc. Why don't you try interning with a photographer? That would teach you a lot of the technical stuff and allow you to learn the ropes. You'd get to travel depending on the photographer you're working with and also help you meet other people in the field. ""Abba Nahi Manenge"" No dream is meaningless.... Follow your dreams but with right guidance!!! Really give a strong think. Is photograhy to you something serious or just a hobby? Would you like if you were doing in 24/7 instead in free time? Because there are A LOT OF people out there who are really good photographers but do it as a hobby. 
My point is we often mistake hobbies for careers. Photography is cut throat career and is one that entirely depends on you as an individual . If you think doing photograpy > earning money, go for it. It means you have a passion and  photography is the most important thing for you regardless of how much it pays. If not, yeah focus on something solid for earning money and upskill yourself in photograpy. It's a good dream but if you want to make serious money as a photography, it's VERY hard in India. Also being a professional photographer is not the same as being interested in it. The grind can make you start hating it tbh. I honestly would say stick to a career where you can make money and keep photography on the side. Spend at least 4-5 years as an ametuer and see if you still enjoy. Use the money you earn to get better gear. Imo professional photography nowadays depends on not only your own creative talent,but your ability to reach out and connect to people. In other words get out there!And  make sure to maintain a good portfolio.Oh and also patience,lots and lots of patience.

And no,you do not need a degree of any sorts(Many good photographers are self taught). DM me .....your story sounds like mine. I also love photography and helped a friend establish a photography business by working very closely. I'll give you the whole PICTURE of professional photography in india Follow your dreams bro...

"[OC] Just messing around with my camera two days ago. Complete newbie to photography and image processing. What do you think of this image of a rather photogenic cloud and the moon? [Kolkata] [Sony a6000+E35mm f/1.8 lens] [ISO100, f/10.0, 1/8s exposure, 6020x4023]  Photography is all about light and shade

Next composition 

And then subject

Some might say subject is important, but without first two, it won't be a striking photograph. 

You got the light and shade aspect down.

The composition could use some work, since there is no balance between the cloud and moon (both equally important subjects in your frame) 

Keep at it. Learnmore about composition and lighting from the vast resources available on the net. [I like this colourised version too.](https://i.imgur.com/2FBnUFc.jpg)",Photography

"The level of sycophancy at my office is unreal  Avoid work WhatsApp groups. Use a prehistoric phone for work and show them why you can't join WhatsApp. That'll shut them up. There is settings in whatsapp to restrict people from automatically adding you into groups I tell people I don't use whatsApp for privacy reasons (Facebook owned etc etc). Some went ahead and asked if 'something happened' :P. Or you can say you dont use it because you feel it takes up too much time.

"Visiting India  Hey, welcome to India. You don't have to worry about street photography in India because people will come to you for selfie for sure. 

You are coming at right time. The weather is good, you can enjoy the food. Go to food streets, Taj Mahal (drive in afternoon), gardens, historical sights, India gate and more. Feel free to msg if you need any more detailed info. Hi, Welcome to India! I hope you have a great trip here, apart from business.
As such, I do not think you would have issues doing street photography, people generally do not mind. If you think someone would mind, just let them know - and they will tell you if they don't want. I guess it would only be women being photographed that you need to worry about. Mostly, be careful of your gear in public to avoid something getting stolen.
Buildings can be photographed, as long as they are not government buildings, which may land you in a soup. Some historic places require separate tickets for professional photography, be sure to buy that. Also, if someone heckles you over rules, stand your ground. People do this for money, but don't mean to hurt.
Please be vigilant while you travel specially in public transport. 
In Delhi, Red Fort, Qutab Minar, Rashtrapati Bhavan, Jana Masjid, Akshardham are must visit. You can also do Agra for Taj Mahal, Fatehpur Sikri. Jaipur is also a short distance from Delhi, with great forts to visit.Golden temple in Amritsar is also very good option. It maybe be best if you can take a local along. Tourist places can be mad crowded.
Visit old Delhi for street food delicacies. If this is your first visit, bring a strong stomach and the food will not disappoint you. I guarantee.
Let us know how it went. Enjoy! Welcome! 

It's completely okay to take pictures, and if you're not too shy, it's completely okay to dance like a maniac, roll on the streets, whatever. If you're comfortable around people different from you, people might even interact in funny ways, ask for pictures with you, stare, etc. etc.

It's going to be very crowded, possibly polluted. Very hot, unless it's within a month from now. 

Places are qutb minar, red fort, etc. etc. just try to be assertive so as to not get fleeced, and preferably go early morning to avoid the traffic, if it's not to hazy for your pictures.

You can't do anything disrespectful to them. only in temples, you have the be barefoot, sometimes cover your head, sometimes photography not allowed, but you will get to know about all that there itself. Beware of shoe stealers, pickpockets, all that jazz. Very common. And no need for the namaste's, they never happen. Delhi is capital and crowded and is coldest in 100 years , and these all in delhi monument can be done in one day , my advice is to book a cheap flight and go to south where the good weather is , andaman or kerela see the natural beauty and good weather ,avoid north at this time as it is very cold

If not then just go to agra for tajmahal and if possible jaipur to ahve good photography",AskIndia

Studying abroad has broader exposure; you can 'flex your capability' and attract curious on-lookers. The former options are pretty much linear given how the Indian academic and social system works.

Edit: As far as ""preparing for your potential"" is concerned that's a broad subject matter. What are your interests? And how does your capability match with those interests.

"What is prospect of photography in India?  I have a cousin who occasionally comes to Bangalore to get her photography taken from brands and freelancers. She’s very into the modeling industry.

She’s had lots of pictures taken, but hasn’t paid even once. One time a photographer traveled for over an hour just so he could take free pictures and put it on his Instagram.
This person as far as I can tell has done this a lot of times to gain some followers.
He still hasn’t succeeded, he still has 800 the last time I checked.

Luckily since he’s been helping out my cousin she started paying him for his pictures. 
I think she paid him 3,000INR for 4 hours of shoot.

It’s hard being a photographer. I reckon that’s the first time he got paid.
Now he seems to be doing fine getting more connections. This took him over a year though.
So it’s hard work and requires lots of traveling.
I haven’t answered your question properly, but hope it helps. If you have any questions let me know I’ll ask and let you know.

As for money, learning to code pays off big time.  I did mechanical and am currently freelancing.
I started off with just HTML, CSS and JS. Which is like majority of the work most clients need.
Currently taking a break to learn a few more skills, and learning to code for these past years has paid off.

Photography is possible as well, but I reckon finding a job is way more hard especially since so many have a Instagram photography page and will do it for free.

Movies like “Neelakasham pachakadal chuvanna bhoomi, Charlie, Bangalore days, Neram, Maheshinte Prathikaaram, Kali etc” made me change/improve my character, personality, the way I treat people and so many things I learned. 

Simple story makes an impact with extraordinary screenplay and also with very dedicated artists. Example, Njan Prakashan, Kumbalangi nights, Angamaly Diaries(one of my favourite). All these movies are just perfect to watch anytime with anyone and make the FEEL GOOD notion in the end. 

Now, Jallikattu, I request everyone not to miss it from theatre. This is something else. A great piece for them. Can’t utter a word about the movie.

I left taking portraits when I found my interest in Travel photography. Instagram (@xtermist) I my self am an amateur photographer and I post on Instagram. What my personal thinking is that, only people who are very close to you, like family might feel a bit weird per se. 

But other than that, your friends or people who really appreciate photography should be fine with  it. 

Personally, I don't think I can post any such pictures, I can't even post portraits of my friends smoking because my parents and close family follow me on Instagram. 

In conclusion, I think only your family and maybe teachers (i honestly don't know about them) will react oddly. But if you don't have a problem and want to showcase your are, please do so. It'll be a good experience and if you get negative feedback, you can always stop if you want.

"[Career Advice] Exploring opportunity in IT sector.  Hi, OP. Congratulations on persevering in your achievements. 

What do people in IT do? Write software. Where you need to be in order to be able to get into the industry is be able to do things:

1. Clear interviews
2. Write software 

\## Getting Interviews

Recruiters in the IT industry hire from :

1. colleges via campus recruitments
2. or from other companies - they look for prior experience. 
3. employee referrals 

Having no job title that says you are a developer and applying out of the blue will have your resume get silently rejected - you won't even hear a rejection from them. 

Since you're trying to crack into IT industry your best strategy is - put together some examples of you making software. Make pieces of software on somewhere like github and host it online. If you made a desktop application - put together a slideshow of the features of the application as a powerpoint presentation. If you made a web app. Put a live instance of it somewhere and link to it from your resume. 

Then get one of your friends or acquaintances who work in a IT company to refer you. Companies usually pay employees a bonus for a successful referral. So there is nothing to lose for this acquaintance and only some cool windfall if you make it. So they'll gladly refer you. A lot of people even refer people out of the blue on LinkedIn so that's possible too. 

If you apply directly to a company out of the blue with no prior experience - they'll just delete the email/resume. But there are some places where people overlook past job titles if the candidates seem to come across passionate - has made software in free time and has samples to show despite not having the background. These are fewer in number but they are there. Which entails that you have to get that first software developer title on your resume. You can't fake it. Employers have cornered labour in India by requiring a signed document from previous employers saying that so and so person has worked here for so and so years. 

\## Clearing Interviews 

1. I talk about these as two different things because they are, as things go in the industry, unfortunately parallel and sometimes even orthogonal skills depending on the organization you are trying to join. What I mean is - what an organization often tests you - the skills they look for when interviewing you are often quite theoretical - data structures, algorithms, big o notation. Those you can pick up with \[a book like this\]. That is literally the only book you will need to read and internalize to cover the theoretical aspects you need to master. Those people who went to 4 year CSE degrees? You've just levelled with them by reading this one book. Trust me. It's that good. And that is all they look for.  Read it cover to cover. BECOME that book. 

2. Then there is the practice of writing code. Not everything you encounter will be available in that book. Companies look for programming aptitude. Which means they will ask you to write programs like ""find the second largest number in a list of numbers"". You won't find them in any book. You will be able to apply your ability to code to make that program work.

3. Knowing a language properly. It is important that, when you are starting out, to know one thing properly. If you want to be a Java developer - show proficiency in using Java. This is knowledge - can you code in this specific toolset - do you demonstrate proficiency in a way that you can start delivering value from day one and not require any ""training""? 

In the process of clearing interviews, you will have learnt what you needed to write software to survive the job so you're set that way. You seem to have  Devops or Site Reliability Engineer hobbies. But you have experience in UI/UX design. Market obviously prefers experience. So you have those two choices to break into the IT industry. Product guy here.

"[SERIOUS] I am stuck with my career and could use some guidance on what to do next. I am genuinely lost.  I am a graphic designer too, and I can relate to that thing you said where you started hating designing casually because of your job. I have come to that point that nowadays I am like why put so much thought into this, just get it over with. About your mentor talking about not studying, he is partly right in a sense that you will mostly learn about software and shit more in institutes in India. But I have heard top colleges like NID and all actually helps you improve, but dunno how exactly.

I am also in a very similar boat as you where I would just want to get over with the work that is assigned to me without thinking much and shit. I realized this follow your passion route is pointless when you have no proper passion only. One of my friends who is as passionless as me is working as a UI/UX designer at McKinsey in Chennai. His work is truly pathetic for someone of his experience, but he gets paid some 2 to 3 times more than me, has fixed hours and weekends off. I was thinking of taking that job up because like you, I don't care about passion and all anymore. But right now, I cannot make a move to Chennai so that's out.

Hope you find a solution to this issue. A graphic designer here. My 2nd job now, in one of biggest automobile industries in world.

I get you, I completely get you how you've been bored by your job. But it can be said about any other job.

**Graphic design is tough.**

If you're in ad agency, you're fucked. They pay a lot but your timings will be **almost** 11 hours work excluding travelling. I'm talking about proper ad agency who works for big brands. 

**GO IN FINANCE SECTOR**

Finance companies are in need of good graphic designers. They pay well and don't have a lot of creative demand.

Most of the designs are simple 'we have launched new schemes' with barely 4 bullet points Among the many choices available for a graduate engineer with work experience, It would be wise to avoid confusion and pursue a career in any of the original job forms.

Design, art and the creative aspect. I myself pursue writing as a career and feel the need to learn and explore in order to continue to be relevant in the job market. This is true for most of the Tech jobs. The level of commitment invested in your salaried job is paid off as monetary benefits and will help you lead a routine. 

All jobs in general that ask for 9-5 presence and desk deliverables within a stipulated frame or schedule are sure to cause a burn-out or at least some symptoms such as tiredness, uneasiness. It is of utmost importance that we identify these symptoms and plan break/leaves accordingly.

On continuing to work with the industry, we should first accept the terms and adhere to a disciplined lifestyle. Planning off-work routine and staying committed to a contractual obligations requires intense practice.

For now, practice working on new skills. Try for suitable opportunities and present yourself freely. Discuss openly regarding your requirements and if the job is interesting.. it is going to be good deal! How about trying other fields of design. Maybe interior design or something? Dude, work is work. You do if only for money and status. Didn't mix up passion and work. Just get your work done asap in o that you can do whatever the fuck you're passionate about in the extra hours. OP I would suggest not giving up completely on graphic design because you seem to have a passion for it.

It seems more like you are jaded with the job description and I would suggest looking at pivoting to something graphic design related but which lines up with your interests/workflow better.

Maybe you could try web design? Learn basic HTML and try out UI/UX development? These are skills you can learn to a competent level just from resources available freely on the internet. 

Courses in graphic design in India are mostly only learning different software/tools to use etc, and I doubt you'll find a course that would actually teach basic design concepts well unless you get into NID for example.

Try and figure out what kind of content you enjoy making and focus on it. 

And as always, make sure you have a regularly updated portfolio of your work ready for show if people ever ask for it. A personal website is a great way to do this. (And if you like the web design idea, you could set a personal portfolio website as your first learning project)",AskIndia

"I started my Btech degree yesterday at the age of 25.  More power to you bro. Wish you all the best! [deleted] 25 is still an early age. I've known a lot of people who went to college in their 30s and are doing quite well.

Just make sure you use what you learn and build useful things. Congrats on bouncing back! Also, just remember that majority of Indian engineering institutions are filled with professors who have no idea about the industry. Unless you're lucky, you'll mostly only end up with a useless degree at the end of 4 years. Just keep learning new things on the side and build a few pet projects for your resume. Just my two cents. You are an inspiration bro. Just one thing, don't wait for graduation to start earning money. Learn new things and start doing freelance work. When I was in college, the schedule seemed so hectic that I didn't find any time to do anything apart from study and a little sports. But now in job, I realize I had a lot of free time then and could really do better things than just wasting it on bakar. Do competitive programming, contribute in open source, pick relevant projects, maintain a good github profile and take up online courses on new technologies. You have a unique advantage of maturity that most of your batchmates don't. Perspective changes with age and there's more clarity on what to choose based on how much value it's gonna add. Use that advantage. You know there are millions of people who wish they could redo their college days with the same level of maturity and wisdom that they have now and you my friend are living their dream. So keep the motivation up and make the best out of these four years that you have. That's such an inspiring journey .. imo opinion failures are necessary for success .. those who succeed without failure cannot grasp the true value of achievements Better late than never. I was feeling quite anxious today about my career and I am just 21. Just graduated, dropped CA, picked up CFA. 
Now I've been applying for jobs and so far not much has happened. I was feeling defeated but I guess we only lose when we  stop trying. 
More power to you, to me and everyone who needs. 

You'll land on your feet because you are willing to work and that's what matters at the end of the day. Fellow front-end dev here. Hit me up for any sort of help at any time! Please get scientific paper published by the end of your [B.Tech](https://B.Tech). Contribute to open source projects. These are my suggestion. A good career awaits you. You shall be inspiration for others and me. Let me know If i can help you in any way. Good luck!!! I wish there is someway I can reach out to you and hang out.     

I am also from JU - I started my undergrad in a crappy engineering college at Bangalore. I loved Bangalore, loved Kannada people but hated engineering and the college. I grew up in Jodhpur Park - right next to Jadavpur University. I even had ice cream when the chemical engineering department used to make them as an experiment? I think it was the chem engg dept but I could be wrong. You were probably in first year when I was in PG1.   

I did not face any of the adversities that you do - not even half of them. As I read your post, I realized how privileged a life I have had.    

None the less, dropped out of engineering - joined JU Arts. As much as people hate on JU arts - they are the most liberal people I have seen. There was a senior in the faculty who was also an engineering dropout and he would reach out to every dropout who came to JU arts and encourage them. Mind you there were plenty and weird as it may sound all of them are doing so well in their lives now!   
 
Anyways, JU arts turned it around for me. I did decently there, went onto get 2 masters and then finally into a PhD which I am hoping to graduate next year. I am 31 now and ironically I code for statistical analysis now. I had dropped out of CSE engineering and the only difference is I like what I do now.   

The moment I read JU, I hoped JU would be the turning point for you - just as it was for me. But we all have our own stories and our own journeys to take.   
 JU is and will remain my alma mater and anyone who is remotely connected to the institution as a student is nothing but family.     

Don't let people tell you what to do and how to do it. I have had really stupid people both in JU and mostly outside tell me that I would amount to nothing  - because I dropped out and because of my age. Bro, I started my PhD at 27 - two students I met in my cohort 1. An American African woman aged 41 2. A White gentleman aged 55 who had just retired from American Army. These two were older that most of the cohort which was by average 35 years old and what a bloody inspiration they were to the PhD cohort. PhD cohort's have a pretty high dropout rate but the gentleman was one of the few full time students who cleared the qualifiers at one go, especially the econometrics paper. While the lady was not that good at maths, she fought on and eventually cleared both the theory and econometrics paper. They outworked younger candidates like me and brought in all the experience they had gathered to research projects. I ended up being really good friends with both of them. In fact they are the closest friends I have on campus. So no, age is honestly a number and nothing else - fight the good fight!  


If you ever feel like talking to someone or hanging out - please reach out to me! This was actually my last summer break here in the country and I will be in Philadelphia for most of the graduating year but if there is anything I can help you with - please reach out! I am more than happy to hang out as long as am in the country.   

And again - fight the good fight, I am sure you will do great.   
I leave you with a song that I used to listen to when I got depressed in JU about my career trajectory. The song was an anthem for us dropouts - Pulak da wrote the song. Pulak da was from Philosophy department and died in a road accident. I thought you might like this : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVmqXFJtN-A It’s never too late to do anything.

"B.Tech. student with absolutely no idea what to do next...Need advice..  HMI is a field which has a creative side to it, where knowledge of computer science does help, albeit not a lot. 

You should at least get _some_ job and use your spare time to find what interests you, rather than be unemployed. Continue atleast a year into your course related career or else you'd lose this career path forever. I know so many people who took up sales after doing cse engg and most of them regret atleast not trying to get into a technical field as it closed a door for them forever.

Maybe you're afraid of failure and dropping something than falling at it and running after newer shinier object is your thing.

"Which phone should I go for ?  >Redmi Note 3 is retiring

F

Legendary phone [deleted] How much are you looking to spend? >Should I go for a flagship ?

If camera, haptic feedback, processor is important for you. Go for it.

My suggestion would be to go with previous gen flagship ie with snap 845 processors.

1) Lg G7- Last month bought LG G7 for my dad at 20K after exchange +bank discounts+sale. Great phone, weak battery. For camera and audio, this would be the best phone. Full manual control over photo+video. Quad dac, boombox speaker. 

The LG v40 has a bigger battery and same features but is priced quite high right now. If you can wait, go with this. 

2) Asus zenfone 5Z- Last week it was available for 22K. 

3) One plus 7

If your budget is around 20-30K go with these rather than Midrange like Samsung A50, A70. Have a look at Motorola One Power (12k) and Motorola One Vision (20k). 

They've Stock Android so you'll love its UI and no ads like some Chinese brands. It'll receive security and android updates for 3 years. I've used Moto G1 & G5s plus and I've pretty satisfying experience with both. G1 lasted for 4.5 years and still no issue with G5s plus after 2 years. I've dropped my G5s plus 20-30 times from the height of 3-4 feet but screen is still good! What's your reason for switching from RN3? If it's software I suggest putting on a custom ROM (clean flash). I use the RN3 as well and have been able to keep it snappy till date flashing ROMs and kernels to maintain temps and battery life.
I'd vote for the K20

"Is photography a hobby only for rich guys?  My colleague, a lookdev artist used to quote:   
""Camera is a mere tool, it's the eyes and brain behind it that matters"".   
    
That dude had a beautiful photo blog, with pictures shot on a 3 megapixel, point and shoot camera.  
    
    
Photography used to be a rich guy's hobby before the digital age. 
We used to shoot carefully to use one single roll for our college assignments.  
Every wasted frame was crime. It depends.

 I personally believe that a lot of beginners just get great equipment and the camera does everything, they're satisfied. They crank up the focal length and blue the background, and suddenly call it great photography.

Crystal clear photographs != good photography. 

A good photography depends highly on the composition of the image, a sort of mood that it evokes. I know that it sounds kinda pretentious, but that's what I believe it is. I used to do casual photography, nothing great, and to date my favourite photograph is one which I clicked on my phone.

That being said, entry DSLRs cost around 25-26k and they're more than enough to get you started with photography. Everyone is a photographer these days. So unless it's a hobby you are committed to, and you know your stuff, don't spend money. You get decent cams everywhere. Also every chutiya these days has a camera around his neck if you walk around. Learn composition and lighting. Then comes the resolution and sharpness.

Most people do not learn composition or lighting. I have a Canon 5D, Mark III, Nikon entry level DSLR, a Canon point and shoot digital camera and an iPhone XR. Guess which one I use for photography nowadays. My phone. I rarely take out the other equipment because my iPhone (or for that matter any smart phone) lets anyone to take great pictures by fine tuning the aperture, exposure and shutter speed and what not. And then you have a myriad apps to do post processing. 

So yeah, once upon a time photography was a rich person’s hobby but it is anyone hobby today and there are a gazillion places to learn, fine tune the pictures and showcase your photos... so no, photography is anything but a rich person’s hobby.
P.S. don’t get me wrong, costly equipment makes a lot of difference but remember, today’s smart phone can do ten times more than any camera did twenty years ago so the limiting factor is your mind. Not the damn camera. Camera saste me dilwao toh humara bhi angle and perspective mast hai.",AskIndia

"Why do people spend years preparing for civil service exams?  1. It's not that easy for most people to accept failure and move on. The more years you have put in, there is more of sunk cost fallacy at work. If you accept you can't cut it anymore, it's like accepting your last 4-5 yrs were a waste. Disclosing it to parents and relatives is tougher.

2. As the years go down the drain, it becomes more difficult to do something else. Jobs aren't readily available, you can't do masters, can't really expect to do an MBA from a top 20 college unless you have stellar acads and manage a 99.8+ percentile.
Your only true options are SSC or Bank exams, which are a massive step down and difficult for most to accept.

3. And the biggest of them all, laziness. Both of the above points can be overcome if you're honest to yourself and are willing to move out of your comfort zones, but the laziness inside most prevents them from doing that. 1. For fair curvy chick in marriage

2. Bribes Surely there's something wrong with that 1) Despite considerable improvement in private sector jobs, government jobs are very coveted and civil services are the crown jewel of government jobs

2) Guaranteed dowry and high leverage in marriage

3) Unparalleled perks by GOI, influence and status in society

4)  $$$ Its all about power and influence. Ab kahe toh kya kahe.. having been in this cycle for few years and missing out on final list couple of times I can only say that it's a chakravuyh I can't escape .. This is the point of view of someone who gave up after a year and a half of preparing for these exams. You can decide for yourself whether this is relevant or not.

Fortunately, I hadn't just dropped everything and joined a full-time class. Instead, I was using pretty much all my waking hours outside of work to familiarise myself with all of the standard exam-prep textbooks.

**Why I started**

- I definitely had some grandiose vision of being respected by everyone I knew if I could just crack this exam
- I thought that all my money woes would be gone forever
- I was actually looking forward to a life of moving from one town to another every few years -- even better if I could make it to the foreign service!
- I rationalised the insane amount of time I spent on studies by reasoning that it was all useful knowledge at the end of the day, irrespective of whether I made it or not
- Reading some of the books heightened my sense of duty to the nation. I had never been very patriotic before this but I felt that if I passed the exam, I could contribute to improving the state of affairs in a significant way

**Why I stopped**

- When I told one of my managers that I was planning on quitting in order to take up preparation full-time, he took me aside for a serious talk and explained how I was jumping the gun. He talked about his trips to other countries, about his own plans to settle abroad, and asked me to wait till I had seen a bit of the world. He told me to take a few more months and consider all of the options available to me before making a permanent change. Granted he might have been acting on behalf of the company to keep me from quitting at a crucial juncture, but I'm grateful to him nonetheless

- Around this time, I also started reading about former candidates who'd joined the service hoping to make an impact, only to find themselves at the mercy of an incompetent turd of a minister.

- Two very good friends of mine had started preparing full-time, and I saw first-hand their withdrawal from social life and it made me realise that this was not how I wanted to spend my 20s. I had struggled so much to get a well-paying job and to just give it all up to go back to the life of a student seemed like the wrong move. One of them has now joined the CRPF, and the other was still trying to crack IAS mains after 3 attempts.

**How I feel about it now**

I'm definitely glad that I gave up before it was too late. At the time it felt like I was a coward to give up on some grand dream of mine, but I'm convinced that I've had a lot more fun in my 20s than I would have if I'd have spent all that time studying.

That being said, I do admire the determination of everyone who studies for this exam. Especially the ones for whom this might be the only shot at a good life. 1. To get married to someone who has government job.
2. They think they will get more respect as government servant than any other job.
3. To ""secure"" the future. I believe it has got to do with confidence and fear. 

Suppose you've written the exam once, the next time you're going at it you will get into a mindset where you believe you know the whole pattern what to study, what not to study and everything. 

Adding on to some other comments, people really have nothing else to do ie no where to go. Working for jobs that pay you 10k per month or less is demeaning to the degree you pursued no matter how employable you are or not. 

And most importantly the fruit. Civil services put you into a premier class, all that power and money are enticing and to someone who doesn't have neither it sounds like the best way forward. 

When I wanted to prepare for civils I got a few opinions, that strongly stuck with me:

1. You should have a point of no return. My dad clearly told me that there's no point in attempting is 4-5 times, you will continue screwing up because you have so many attempts on hand. And as you said wasting prime years being an improtant aspect, how will you justify to your employer or Institute after those years? 

2. It takes some intelligence, no matter how hard you study and plan your efforts out only the smart people will get in. It's the truth tbh, it's not for everyone. You can't pick up some random person and get them to crack it, they need to display some sort of intelligence. 

3. Corruption, point being you spend so much time after this exam only to end up under political bosses who will toy with you if necessary. I do not want to sound ominous but you as a person need to make an informed choice, it's not a simple one. Sukhi, a famous singer from Bollywood has sung a glorious song which encompasses the life of civil services aspirants.
....


Song is called ""nasha hi nasha hai"" Man, I know. 

I have close relatives (""IITans"") who quit plush jobs to prepare for Civil services, and regret it now.

A friend of mine quit his job and tried for like 4 yrs and finally joined a company. I think he earns like half of what I do now.",Non-Political

"Skill development thread  I'm no expert but I've been doing photoshop/premiere and ableton live for about 5 years now. Just gonna cite some sources 

>Photoshop

For photoshop look for the channel 'Piximperfect' to learn basics such as masking, layers, blending modes etc. Other channel- Photoshop Tutorials

If you're good in photoshop, premiere isn't gonna be tough for you. [Here is a beginner video](https://youtu.be/Hls3Tp7JS8E) 

Also note that there are two versions of premiere : Adobe premiere pro and premiere elements. 

>music production

For music production, choose a DAW and don't change. Stick with it until you get basics right. Most of the stuff you can learn on YouTube itself.
My preference is Ableton Live. But you can go for Audacity(free), Fl Studio, Cubase etc.

Unfortunately both of these things are very costly. DAWs are super expensive.

Edit: Gimp is a free alternative of Photoshop.  If you want to learn about Data Analytics - Machine Learning - AI - all those terms you keep hearing about. Here's a really good track, that's free - all that's needed is time,patience and will to learn.

"Broke up 30! What next???  Chill dude, no need to worry. It's better to be alone than with someone with whom you're not comfortable. Living by yourself has its own advantage.  * You have time. 30 is not that old. Get back out there when you are ready.
* Don't blame yourself, or your ex. If you wanted different things in life and had strong convictions about your choices, either one of you would have had to compromise and deal with the resentment that typically follows compromising core beliefs or the relationship would have fallen apart at some point if neither one wants to compromise. 
* If it had to end, Its better it ended now and not after you were married and in your late thirties or later.
* Give it some time and re-evaluate, feelings always clouds reality. Everyone feels like the universe is conspiring against them after something bad happens. Time heals most wounds if you let it.
* Stay Positive. I am 33 years old, have never been in a relationship, no marriage proposal seems to work out for myriad reasons, yet I keep faith while also keeping fit, enjoying my life, finding new interests and try to travel as much as I can amidst incredibly heavy pressure from my parents and ""society"". Last thing one needs is to give in to bullshit societal standards. Love has no sell by date.
* You mentioned you love to travel, do more of it, its a great distraction. Plan a trip in the near future. Travel has healing and transformative powers.

I wish you all the best!
  The dude lived in the city for 20+ years and wants to go farm? Let him. He seems passionate about it, don’t hold him back.

As for you, you are too young to be worried about what’s gonna happen to you. Take it easy and move on; you have no idea what’s in store. 

That ablanaari shit was funny though 😊 >I am scared that I might end up alone given the age taboo/caste etc in India and quite not sure how to deal with all the negativity in my head

Stop worrying about that crap and work on making yourself a better person. Pickup some new hobbies. Hang out with your friends or try making new ones. I have to admit that I have not travelled as much as you did.

But my only suggestion right now is to pack your bag and leave your home.
 You will get a  better solution as I am pretty sure you will meet up someone who has solutions to all your problems. 

LPT: Just talk to as many people as possible. find new things to do. the less you sit and ponder, the better it'll be. give it time, and then ponder, and let go.

live life forward, not backwards. You took the right longterm decision. The blaming, bitterness and sadness for a few months is common. Convince and coax your mind that you took a good positive long-term decision for the reasons you have yourself mentioned. 

*Express* your thoughts and justifications and plans in some way. For me, writing them in detail in a diary worked. But if you're not into writing, record an audio or video of yourself discussing it with yourself. 

Or if you have a close friend who's a good listener, express it in front of them. I don't know the psychology behind why expressing your thoughts to yourself or others actually helps, but it does.

As for fear of society, most people don't bother and those who trash talk you can be ignored or even belittled. Solo life is not bad as you yourself already seem to have explored it quite a bit. I'd suggest getting into any new relationship only for positive reasons - such as love and companionship - and never for negative or shallow reasons - such as fear / reputation / social status.  take it from a 24 y/o guy, who got cheated multiple times and lost faith in love.

&#x200B;

Smoke a joint, let go off things, and start afresh. 30 ain't too old. You still have a good 4-5 years before you settle down. Goodluck and learn to forgive but not forget :) 30+something, just broke up. Its very normal to hate your ex even if he/she hasnt done anything horrible.

Be kind to yourself. Im not a believer in god or spirituality but mindfulness has helped me. What are you going through is grief. Its the same feeling as you would feel if a loved one died.

1. Ponmudi - a small hill station near Trivandrum (about an hour away)

2. Brymore - it is an eco-park with little streams and small waterfalls

3. Varkala - epic cliffs overlooking the beach. Here you can go nuts with your drone! Varkala is about an hour away. Awesome place to chill - there are some good hostels there to crash as well

4. Padmanabhaswamy Temple - the richest temple in the world is easily the must visit in Trivandrum. It is right in the heart of the city.

5. Veli Lake and Veli Beach

6. Kovalam Beach - a black sand beach which is a big tourist attraction

7. Valiyathura Paalam (or Pier) - a pier extending into the sea offering awesome views of the coastline. Again awesome place for some drone photography Have appam with stew for breakfast r/kerala Go to Kovalam and have fish from some of the restaurants in the beach.

"Could Covid-19 increase the average scientific understanding in Indians?  No ! No way.
Most of the folk still swear by WhatsApp University. What do you exactly mean by disillusionment with science? The greatest enemy of science in today's world is religion. Religion is mostly a business designed to take advantage of human stupidity, so it's not going to vanish anytime soon if you ask me. The humanity is not facing a pandemic for the first time, so religion won't be giving up easily in 2022 or whenever science develops vaccine for it. In my opinion, it will happen some day, but not in this century at least. Some of them, yes. They read and watch doctors and scientists speak on TV.

Majority still goes by Whatsapp and other stuff. Once a vaccine is found they will go back to Hindu-Muslim. Excuse me? All you need to understand about Covid is Surya Grahan blah blah... The moon aligns above blah blah... Elena Gilbert blah blah... Modi will go Super Saiyan 2 and Blast Covid into the sun. This is the truth. WhatsApp and 15 imaginary sources have confirmed it. Noooo. No. There was a video by the quint on how much average rural indian knows about pandemic and what do they do to prevent it.

A teenage boy in that video said that modiji said wear mask, bang thalis and light diyaa.

People take politicians, actors and religious gurus as source of information for everything from religious matters to health issues, not scientists or doctors. Polio vaccination campaign succeeded because Amitabh Bachchan was the face, not because people actually understand crippling deformities caused by polio.

I don't expect any increase in scientific temperament in foreseeable future. Not sure; what it would increase is BJP's vote share. Many people strongly believe that only a BJP government could do what it did; nop other party could have done it. lol. just talked to my doctor friend in the morning who has been using the same surgical mask for 7 days.

#Pure Comedy
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*~Father John Misty*  

The comedy of man starts like this  
Our brains are way too big for our mothers' hips  
And so Nature, she divines this alternative  
We emerged half-formed and hope that whoever  greets us on the other end  
Is kind enough to fill us in  
And, babies, that's pretty much how it's been ever   since  

Now the miracle of birth leaves a few issues to   address  
Like, say, that half of us are periodically iron     deficient  
So somebody's got to go kill something while I look    after the kids    
I'd do it myself, but what, are you going to get this   thing its milk?  
He says as soon as he gets back from the hunt, we   can switch  
It's hard not to fall in love with something so   helpless  
Ladies, I hope we don't end up regretting this  

Comedy, now that's what I call pure comedy  
Just waiting until the part where they start to   believe  
They're at the center of everything  
And some all powerful being endowed this horror   show with meaning  

Oh, their religions are the best  
They worship themselves yet they're totally   obsessed  
With risen zombies, celestial virgins, magic tricks,   these unbelievable outfits  
And they get terribly upset  
When you question their sacred texts  
Written by woman-hating epileptics  
 
Their languages just serve to confuse them  
Their confusion somehow makes them more sure  
They build fortunes poisoning their offspring  
And hand out prizes when someone patents the   cure  
Where did they find these goons they elected to   rule them?  
What makes these clowns they idolise so   remarkable?  
These mammals are hell-bent on fashioning new   gods   
So they can go on being godless animals  

Oh comedy, their illusions they have no choice but   to believe  
Their horizons that just forever recede  
And how's this for irony, their idea of being free is a   prison of beliefs  
That they never ever have to leave  

Oh comedy, oh it's like something that a madman   would conceive!  
The only thing that seems to make them feel alive   is the struggle to survive  
But the only thing that they request is something   to numb the pain with  
Until there's nothing human left  
Just random matter suspended in the dark  
I hate to say it, but each other's all we got Religion is the main cause of unrest in India. Religion is one intense fandom. Religion is legalised madness

Edit: Thank you for the shining silver kind stranger. [deleted] To all those parents and students who called Moral Science classes a sham, this is why we needed it. Religion is an expired product that has continued to stay. It should have been eradicated or died a while back but has not. If we as species have to reach next level then we need to get over religion. Any existing religion is like Superman, did wonders on paper but doesn't actually exists. “When you call yourself an Indian or a Muslim or a Christian or a European, or anything else, you are being violent. Do you see why it is violent? Because you are separating yourself from the rest of mankind. When you separate yourself by belief, by nationality, by tradition, it breeds violence. So a man who is seeking to understand violence does not belong to any country, to any religion, to any political party or partial system; he is concerned with the total understanding of mankind.”

― Jiddu Krishnamurti


Questioner :  Kindly give a straight reply. Does god exist, or not? Yes, or no? If yes, how best to realize him in this life?

JK : ""If you examine very closely, you have created god. Right? In India there are about – I was told there are about 300,000 gods and more. (Laughs) You understand? Every local person has his own god.

So, sirs, we have created god. See the irony of it. Thought has created god and then thought worships the image which thought has created. Which is, to worship oneself and call it god. You understand all this? – the better part of you is god. Right? I wonder if you understand this. First of all, let’s be clear. Have you created god? The local gods round the corner, or the local god in Rome, or in Tirupati, or wherever, you have created them, haven’t you? You are so very uncertain, aren’t you, so frightened. If you say we have created, then you are scared stiff because you have created out of your fear that. Out of your fear you want security. Right? You want safety, you want to feel there is somebody looking after you because you are afraid. You follow? So you create that, and then worship that. Just see what you are doing! Going to Tirupati and putting all your money in the bag – do you think gods want your money? Sir, look at it all. You have nothing to offer but money, garlands, prostrations, rituals. Right? You have nothing else to offer. Have you realised the tragedy of this, sirs?

If you love – not god, that’s very easy to love god because it is an abstraction, it has not much meaning. But if you love, that very love is god, that very love is sacred. You won’t go outside to look for god. You understand all this, sirs!

And the questioner wants to know if I believe in god. I don’t. Because god is something created by man. There is such a thing as eternity, which is to be outside of time. Right, sir? For that you must have a mind, a heart that is completely free from all the burdens of life. Right? From your vanity, your arrogance, your selfishness – you follow, sir? And we say, we are not capable of it, tell us what to do. You are back in the cycle, somebody to tell you what to do. Sir, you are in a jungle, you have to walk through it by yourself. Right? And for that you need vitality and vigour and strength. Not belief in god, in goodness – belief has no place where truth is concerned. Right?""",Politics

"[Serious Post] Bye  You seriously need counseling. These thoughts are no jokes. 

What really blows my mind is how our lives are similar yet different. 

I didn't get any decent job for about 2 years after I finished my B.Tech. When I got one after a year or so my company decided to close the unit and everyone lost their jobs. 

Then I started to teach few students and decided to try for government job. Even cleared all the exams but failed to get into final selection list. 

Then I joined another company and there I got into an accident. 

I severely damaged my arm and doctors told me to avoid heavy work for at least 2 years later. I took few steps back and started to teach in a college as a part time assistant lecturer. 

Even after all the bad luck I never felt hopeless. 

I am still in search for a decent job but I always try to be optimistic. 

I recommend you to get professional help before hurting yourself. You sir, are not a failure. You have managed to persevere till this day even with the constant downs in your life. Better things await you in your life from here on. 

Try getting a professional help as I have heard many people here saying that it really helps. And lastly don't lose hope. Please dm. We can talk. I can totally relate to the post. Don't take this step and take some counselling ASAP. You should try giving highschool students English tuitions. People from small towns will pay good money. Your writing skills are really good. You don't even need a degree to open private tuitions. He is not responding to any of the posts here.....I hope he is alright :( There's millions of others who share your story my friend. Even worse situation than you. Also think about those illiterates ones as well. You know what those illiterates would say to you "" Atleast you are educated, one day or the other you will find a job, whatever it will be, but for us there is nothing else."" 

I'm not stopping you to feel frustrated. But it has no solutions. Saying goodbye here won't change your life soon. It will always be a struggle and even if you find a job, the struggles won't end there. You will be forced to drop all your morality and education into the gutter when situation arises you to do things against your policy and wishes. Cuz then you would call it survival for the fittest.

What you feel right now won't be the same in the future. You have to understand this is real life. You will face this situation when you feel completely lost and in vain. Happens to the best of us and even to the worst. 

Without giving my old cridentials, I'll tell you I used to Manage a floor of 300 employees worldwide. Now for the past decade I work at a local wineshop as a manager. My team consists of uneducated asswipes who steal and behave as if they are hardworking fellas. They think I'm a fool, when I know every angle of their stealing from the shop. But I stay silent and cover their ass cuz they really are hardworking fellas. So do I feel sad that how my life changed, yes. But is it worth it, definitely not. I realized my circumstances and did whatever I could find to survive. Sucking up my standards and ego. If you can do that, you are a winner. 

All the doors aren't shut like you said. Because even I thought all the doors was shut 10 years ago, when I was at ICU battling for my life for 3 days. After 20 days in the hospital, I got discharged with an heavy bill and payments to others. Almost lost my home and family back then. Suicide was the only solution for me. Because my ego didn't allow me to accept failure. Now, I'm here replying to you like a future. Think about it man, 10 years ago, I was you. And I wasn't lucky, it was worse even after backing out of suicide. Nothing changed, I was still the same frustrated man. But there's something called as TIME. it changes things man. It really does. For every living beings. It's the law of the nature. 

You can be anything, only if you want it to be. It is the only truth. Dude, firstly stop whatever you are planning to do.

Just read this thread, one of these suggestions might work for you.

Secondly, don't relate your worth with how much you wealth you have, or even how many friends you have. Remember, at the end of the day, we have to save ourselves. 

So please take care of yourself. Start doing things you like.

Don't like anything? Think about yourself as a child, what were your dreams? What did you like to do? Do that. Watch the clouds, breathe the air, go to any park, sit there. Look at nature, feel that you are alive. 

Listen to your heartbeat. Put a mirror in front of you and cry your heart out. And keep looking at yourself, tell yourself ""it's okay to cry, it's okay to feel down, but this is not the end of me.""

Call your parents, talk to them. Ask about their day, just listen to the sweetness in their voice.

Eat whatever you like. Think of all the good food that you like, go buy some fruits you like, eat that.

Get a new haircut, dress yourself nicely. Go for runs in the morning, exercise or play a sport.

The idea is to keep your body moving, do things that you like, take care of your mental health and tell yourself ""it's okay, it's okay to feel down""  this too shall pass. [And it's not your fault](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQht2yOX9Js).

Another topic I have strong (negative) opinions on is pornography, and since www is the most popular medium for it, I decided to look up IFF's stance on it and found a couple of relevant articles that I'd like to comment on here since there is no ability to do so on the site itself.

* By the way, is the ability to comment on articles being considered for the upcoming revamped website? Perhaps this would fall under ""feedback and co-ownership"" mentioned here.
* Along with the publish dates of articles, it'd be good to see the author's name somewhere as well to be able to compare their views over time in different pieces. It's not exactly clear from the positions listed on the [About page](https://internetfreedom.in/about/) who the editor is.

Following quotes are from [https://internetfreedom.in/porn-is-complex-we-call-for-further-study/](https://internetfreedom.in/porn-is-complex-we-call-for-further-study/):

>While porn is problematic for a multitude of reasons \[...\], the principal regulation in India for it originates from victorian sensibilities. 

&#x200B;

>Why should our lives be governed by British era laws on obscenity? Help us fight victorian sensibilities in 2020.

&#x200B;

>It criminalises healthy adult behaviours and represses desire.

&#x200B;

>More worryingly existing criminal provisions on obscenity are being used for criminalising political dissent.

All are unsubstantiated claims presented as facts.

* How was it concluded that porn regulations in India come from ""British era laws"" or ""Victorian sensibilities"" (I'm assuming the ""v"" was intended to be capitalized)? AFAIK, they were only blocked in the past few years, and if anything, Victorian influence on India and its people would be decreasing over time. Are you saying that porn would've been a-ok in the society of pre-colonial India? The language used here seems rather manipulative to me.
* ""healthy adult behaviours and represses desire"": so, the thousands of years that humans spent without pornography were unhealthy and repressed?
* ""criminal provisions on obscenity being used to criminalize political dissent"": I'd be really interested in seeing an instance where political dissent was *criminalized.* Did it mean to say suppressed? Would still like to see where that happened.

On to [https://internetfreedom.in/why-is-porn-being-blocked-in-india-whattheblock/](https://internetfreedom.in/why-is-porn-being-blocked-in-india-whattheblock/):

>Finally, we recognize the concerning psychological impact of porn production and consumption but we do believe that when viewed privately, it falls within an individual’s right to free speech and privacy. This certainly does not include pornography which has minors present in it, or is created in the absence of consent. To make and view pornography belonging to both these classes is not only a crime, but a deep moral stain that results in long lasting physical and mental harm to the participants who are exploited for its production.

Minor meaning physically under 18? How would you determine that from watching a video? What about cases where an actor is physically an adult but lacks somehow in their mental capacity? Would their consent really count? What about videos where all involved individuals are adult and consenting to the act, but are unaware of being recorded (so, a lack of consent there) but it's not apparent in the video. I've personally come across such cases IRL, and on the web.

>We acknowledge that the ethics of mainstream porn production, particularly the portrayal of women and other minorities, merit study and examination.  
>  
>At present, we maintain that pornography production requires greater diversity and strict enforcement.  
>  
>These are issues beyond the scope of our expertise and we look for leadership from feminist and sex workers’ rights organisations

""other minorities""? ""greater diversity""? Feminist leadership to deal with porn related issues?  It's sort of ironic that both articles complain about British/Colonial/Victorian influence in India *in 2020* (!). Why admit that these subjects are beyond the scope of IFF but then push for porn when it's apparent that there are many issues surrounding it.

>IFF will do what it does best, which is fight for internet freedom and the choice of individual internet users in India. This includes the private consumption of content that is deemed obscene under antiquated, colonial laws which should not find space in modern, progressive India.

The content is ""deemed obscene"" even in modern Western world, let alone India, which is why there are 18+ age confirmations on the porn websites. If it weren't deemed obscene, you wouldn't need the ""private"" in there, so the statement contradicts itself, really.",Politics

"My LLB college will start soon( huge career mistake) , but I am interested in computers, is teaching yourself possible in 3 years without college? Please help!  Yes. Self taught programmers are a plenty. Practice makes perfect. 

Also Patent Attorneys are a thing and can be a fulfilling career for many. Think about being cyber law expert Of course self learning is possible but please be realistic about the kind of time you can dedicate to it. You're a full time student on top of that do you genuinely think you can add 6 hours of work in a day, everyday?     

Be more clear about what you want to learn, broad terms like 'programming' and 'hacking' mean nothing and everything else you have listed is a subset of programming. Not that it is wrong to start from 0, but researching what you want to learn at this stage will benefit you a lot.    
  
List out very clearly what you need to do, make a schedule of what you need to do when and weekly track your progress and tweak your program accordingly. The most difficult thing about self learning is getting the discipline to do it and for it to be lasting experience you need to be realistic about the number of hours you can give without burning out.   
  
You can make a great career for yourself in 3 years even if you are starting from 0.  OSSU is a great list of curated courses, you don't have enough time to do all of them but you do have enough time to learn whatever aligns with your career goals. Also restricting yourself to just MOOCs is quite fruitless, make projects, try contributing to open source projects (since you are a registered student you are eligible for GSOC please look into that), and get relevant internships in startups(since the bigger companies will shy away from you at this point).

2) Pick a language, ideally C++, spend a year or two at it, move to Assembly language, learn writing assembly go to reverse engineering then learn package injection, hooks and sdk development to hack yourself

3) 2D games : Few months of experience will teach you to code games in epic. Unity is pretty easy

4) Making website is easy but again to be reallygood at it you will have to learn java, packet handling server side fetching and a lot of stuffs... which you will learn as you progress but sole focus is not worth unless you want to be Web developer. Trust me self thought programmers are all around our country. A lot of them even shit over the ""professionally/academically certified"" ones. Sorry if it offends anyone.

Honestly I feel if you can embrace the concept of approaching and solving problems and understand how to convert it into code syntactically (heck: even a pseudo code or an understanding as to how it may be executed), you are a programmer. Just embrace the concepts, keep your code simple, try to work towards improving code efficiently and don't jump around a lot on everything that glitters. If you start a concept, finish it or atleast have a good understanding before jumping to the next one. Have lots of hands on experience and be patient and steady while proceeding rather than reactive and erratic. Wish you all the best for your venture.

"Career change advice  If you're sure about point 3,
Then try UPSC or SSC exams
i.e. IAS IPS or CDS Points number three and five are the most interesting. My advice would be to look into the fields of journalism and the social sector/NGOs et cetera. The most important thing is networking with the people working or planning to work in this field. The easiest way to do that is to get a degree in this field. So, look into Asian College of Journalism, Symbiosis, Tata Institute of Social Sciences and JNU. Also, familiarise yourself with the top names in this field, both organisations and individuals. So, for example, if you want to work on the environment there is Centre for Science and Environment and Sunita Narain. If you want to do something in politics, there's Yogendra Yadav and Swaraj Abhiyan. If you want to work on rural issues there's P Sainath and People's Archive of Rural India. There's also the Teach for India Fellowship which pays around 20K a month I believe and the deadline to submit applications for this year may still be open. If you get it, then you can build connections in this field without necessarily studying for a degree. Become a govt librarian. Maybe? > Would be satisfied with bear minimum of 10-20k per month. 

For how long? Some of the options would pay you 10k for the rest of your life. How about being a history teacher? The main problem I see is that 3 can't be substantiated by 2 or 1. If you feel like switching to arts background go ahead,   don't mind what others say. There are tons of good courses available especially in DU and all where people are desperately trying to get into. Arts may be not holding the stature as engineering in our country but these are the areas in which we need more experts which one day you might just become. TC? YOE?

Believe me, TCS experience holds good value in the market. Meanwhile, pick a technology that you like and learn it thoroughly in your personal time. TCS provides plenty of premium learning resources. Try to do 1-2 projects on that. Then start giving interviews on the tech that you learnt. TCS does not mention the platform you worked on in the company on their experience letter, so you can lie on your resume. You might have to give multiple interviews before you get selected but every setback helps to be better. Also interview everywhere even in companies that you have never heard of.

Also it is better to learn a technology where there are less people on that skill set available in the market. That is a great advantage as it is easier to get a good job with knowledge of say Big Data when compared to Java.

India doesn't actually spend that much money on the space program. BJP spent 27000 cr on their 2019 election campaign.

No matter what is the outcome, I will stand by with ISRO, and I will fight internet battles on their behalf, fuck anyone who thinks ISRO is not competent enough.

"Why is engineering so promoted across India? And it's not even a very good career choice  It might not be what interests you but all things included, it is a better job than nearly everything else out there right after graduation. In most jobs (engineering or otherwise), you have to sit in front of the computer for 9 hours and you cannot take a vacation when you want and you don't even come close to earning what a software engineer earns. It is also the one field where you can get jobs right out of college. You can say about doctors but not everyone has the memorization capacity, dedication and the amount of time and money required to be one.

The only other alternatives are having a business or working as a freelancer on a contract basis. In the first, you are your own boss and can take vacations but end up worrying about the business 24/7. Also, you need substantial capital to start one and most startups fail. The second option of freelancer is a very unstable one.

Indian parents are most concerned about job stability and finding a suitable wedding match, in both of which Software engineering takes a prime spot (unless you have an MBA of course) Hey one doubt... I became project manager but did not get the 50-60lpa.. kahan complaint karoon? I hear what you are saying. I work around technology, and the completely temporary nature of the skills, and how often you have to start all over and learn all-new skills and technology makes me really stressed. 

I want my kids to understand a bit about tech, but I don’t know that I want them to do it as a career. Assuming OP is right (and he's fucking not) Professions where earning more than 50-60 lpa is possible after 8-10 years are:

1. CA
2. Politician (not sure legally though)
3. Own business
4. Actor (at least TV show lead)
5. Doctor
6. Cricket

There maybe more, but let's look at these first. Now compare the contacts, influence, money, luck and most importantly, time required to do moderately well in any of these fields, as compared to engineering.

Hence confirmed, OP trying to be edgy. >It's not a field where you are earning a lot,

don't sit in front of your computer for 9 hours then. And don't work like a slave. **have some self respect** So, what is a good career choice? I am an engineer too got my degree from one of the best engineering college in India...I have been working hard for last 5 years now I can buy Jio net pack without asking money from Family. This is how success looks like.. Fuck that. I wish I'd made an effort in school and landed up an engineer. The 'least-resistant' path to success. If you wanna hit certain milestones in life (financial), engineering is the quickest. Engineering has provided a better platform for us middle class folks to have a secure & settled life. Which is an aspiration for most of the middle class. Because we have no scope for apprenticeship education like plumbers/electricians. These professions are looked down upon. We Indians despise those who work with their hands ( blue collar jobs). As a result only two professional lines are open. Since engineering is a cheaper degree (  4 years =5 lacs as opposed to MBBS, 1 year = 15 lacs) most students opt for it. Lol. It's an excellent career option.

"Seeking advice on Warangal and an educational institution  It's not ranked because it's just one among many other private universities in the country. I'm not aware of how much tuition fee they're charging but, if it's comparable to other well regarded private universities in the state, I'd suggest him to try for those. There's National Institute of Technology in Warangal, which is very well known and there you could find few students coming in from African nations and other foreign countries as well, probably to spend a semester or two there.

If you don't mind me asking, how did he come to know about that institution? He could've probably applied for universities in Hyderabad or any other metro city or even second tier city like Vijayawada, which isn't that far from Warangal. Cities are much safer because you can find someone from your own country(or neighborhood nations) there, studying in some other university. Better try for universities in Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad or any other tier two city in the south.


There are many private universities which do have good facilities and offer quality education, but be careful while choosing. There are probably like only 10% good ones, from among them all. SRM, GITAM are two private universities that I know of in my region. There are probably many such in metro cities but I don't know about any of them right now. Also, he could try applying for public universities, but then it's not gonna be easy. I'm not sure of his aptitude and STEM subject skills so I can't really suggest any public ones. But be sure to check them.


Violence against people of African origin does happen, but if he stays in the metro region and avoids traveling alone to remote areas in the country, he's safe and good. Also, it's better to get connected with students who  came from your country, as they'd be very able to guide you in a better way. I could only help you in suggesting whether the university that you opted for is regionally well known or not, but culturally adjusting is far more important. It'd help if someone you know is in or around that area.


Feel free to ask questions regarding universities or anything else. Hopefully, I can answer them as well. I used to live in Warangal. Many African students studied in NITW. I know of none who studied elsewhere. It was an okay experience for them.

Interestingly, I took an auto one day and an African guy was riding along. The auto driver tried to rip him off but the guy was having none of it. My guess is that these auto drivers try to rip them off any given chance. Other than that I think it was pretty okay for them. There is that subtle racism though, like impulsive mistrust. There's a very tiny African community. If he can get in contact with them, they can advise him on safety and stuff.

CIT is not a college for a foreign national to pursue education in. If the degree has value in Sudan then I guess it's okay but other than it, it's not of much use.

I'm not sure about the possibilities of transfer. He has to discuss that with the institute. Instead of seeking advice about the educational institutions, you should be seeking advice about whether this fellow should be [coming to India at all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KiN0SZPXlAk).

"Need college/career advice  It's not too late for you to switch your field. You are still first year which means there is no better time. Take the leap.
Good luck! Continue in dtu. Contact your placement departnent. See what non-tech roles you can get. Do you want a stable job and regular money supply, eventhough it is small? 

Stay with DTU. 

Want to hunt for jobs or struggle if you can't find one and then again get into the cycle of giving papers and all? 

Go to BSc, as you said no good placement. 

My advice, stay in DTU. 

The focus the world is giving to environment and nature, can lend you a good job, and you really can't predict down the line that what will be job sector in next 3 years. 

Although, if you wish to study CSE, then study on your own, participate in coding competitions and learn core subjects of CSE like Algorithms, Data Structures, Databases. 

Dude, you have backing of DTU. Trust me brand name works in India. 

Also, you would have a professional degree in Btech, BSc ke baad MSc karega, then again 5 years down the line, you can't predict anything. 

Do your btech, study core subjects of CSE, try to go for companies. 

Atleast 3 saal baad job toh milegi, cse ya non cse.

ATB. Dude BSc CS is not a good option, and i am saying this after completion of BSc CS from DU, i will say stick with Btech , and if you really want, try for different branch by taking drop, dont look ar 2yrs gap , because if you do get good college and cs branch, nothing matters after that.
After Bsc you have to again face competition for MCA so i will say Btech is the best option you can go with Disclaimer: I am a final year Dtuite, ece branch.

The information seniors have given you is kind of correct. It is true that the majority of coding companies won't be open for your branch, heck truth be told only 5-10 total companies would be open for ene.

However, Amazon, MS, Uber , Citibank and Samsung are almost open for all the branches . So here are your two choices, either utilise the time you have and practice coding. Join coding blocks or Ninja and work hard. Your branch will always be a handicap for you, this is the bitter truth. Companies do discriminate over your branch. Ene is an easy branch so spend your time wisely. Otherwise try for higher studies. The last person from our College to go to Stanford was from ene only.

"TIL a US company owned by Princely Family of Liechtenstein tried to patent ""Basmati Rice"". The US Patent Office granted a broad patent in 1997 but it was eventually watered down after India challenged the patent and threatened a WTO dispute.  Texmati? Ew. Kuch toh sochke rakh lete. They have tried to patent turmeric as well. Patenting traditional indian medicines and stuff just downright lying about stuff origin, such as yoga poses is quite common in west. Recently i believe there was news of a company trying to patent pattals or leaf bowls and plates there which we use for prashad and bhandara. Every time someone tells me about why patenting is good for inventors and protects their interests which is kind of true, I remind them of all the ways it’s abused and used to bully actual pioneers who just aren’t aware of the law.

"It's time for India to move from a Hindutva inspired vision to a humanist inspired one  1. Are you anywhere else other than facebook?

Damn, that took a while to settle in! I really like the fact that someone in India is actually trying to setup grass roots for humanity development and management.

A few tips from my side:

1) It'd be really awesome if you had a subreddit, cuz Facebook can become really Obnoxious, what with all the meme pages, and all the hundreds of friends that people can have. Atleast with a subreddit, Moderation is much more strict, there's pinned posting allowed, and well, there's a lot more control in general.

2) Are there plans to set up a fort location, i:e One location/constituency, that you'd prefer to start with, and focus on first? Cuz I think if you'd start with one, you might slowly reach state-level, which is more than enough to get the nation's attention. I like your long term approach. Anything is possible with tenacity and will power. Good luck to you. The trouble with your plan is that it will strike the vast majority of Indians as being culturally inauthentic. The idea as presented simply is not Indian. It is just an artificial and weird mish-mash of a lot of things that seem to look good at this stage in history (2019), but it doesn't have deep roots in the soul and soil of the land.

BJP is successful because they have a vision for India that (as per their narrative) is as ancient as our earliest recollections of India itself. This vision is made of songs and stories and Gods and saints that are deeply embedded in a lot of Indians' consciousness and their understanding of who we are. They can cite ancient scriptures as sources of the values they advocate. Their imagery and rhetoric have deep roots in the nation's history. Take the icon of mother India or Bharat Mata. Some say that this idea is just a copy of the corresponding European ideas, but every Hindu sees Bharat Mata as just another instance of Shakti, the mother goddess, which is an idea that has deep roots in the Hindu psyche nourished by a vast fund of religious literature and practices.

What RSS achieved over 50 years is only possible if you believe strongly in one ideology. Religion and their rules are a tool to make people cooperate on a large scale, without which they will not. 

I feel it's impossible to create organized movements in that kind of way anymore, unless you use a strong ideology to unite people. But if you do that, it will create blind faith and extremism and that will be counter your original purpose. Moreover, it will counter act against one of the most important qualities that people need in India - Individualism. 

Look at the best countries across the world, they don't have any popular organized groups throughout the country. The Vegan community is the closest comparision I can think of in those countries and even vegans are famous for being intolerant, adhering to their strictly enforced guidelines within the community. As soon as you place the identitiy of a community or a group above an individual, it will lead to the same result. The devloped countries and their institutions are succesful because the majority doesnt beleive in any single ideology strongly, all of them value individual thoughts so it becomes impossible to compromise everything, all at once. 

Therefore, I don't think you should try to replicate their success. But I also don't know a solution to how it can be possible to impart these important values without making under a banner. I really like this idea, and to be honest I was thinking of something like this myself. I'd really like to join, or at the very least contribute to discussions and present ideas and solutions.
 In addition, somebody mentioned here that the ideology might not appeal to Indians the same way that hindutva does and I believe their statement holds a lot of truth. AAP is an example, so it should be a priority to figure out how to strongly appeal to the masses. 

Overall, I want to thank you for being the change you want to see and for actually doing something lol. Please make a sub, not everyone of us are in FB. Police Reforms are the key to unlock the India's potential, How else do you think we can bring fear in the minds of criminals in India? If this takes off, it'd be great!

"Need for a change of school culture and the hype around class 10th and 12th board exams  I understand completely how you feel towards your mother. My mother’s a teacher, and I have literally seen her give advice to her student’s parents to give their children more freedom to find their passions, to have fun and to focus on then learning skills and confidence, rather than focusing on marks. But when it came to me, it was get marks or die. 

I think part of the problem is that in India there are so few means of evaluating a person beyond their marks. When applying to US universities, you have to write essays, jot down your clubs and extra-curricular activities, the interview will focus on the things you spend time on outside the classroom etc. The marks themselves are just the bare minimum. I feel in India the marks are supreme. I bet the entrance exam culture doesn’t help either.

It also sucks that there are so few premier institutions in India to study at, relative to our population. The US has flagship state colleges in every state, and at least 2 or 3 other unis that are fairly good, not to mention private world-class unis like Stanford and Harvard etc. We needs more high-quality institutes of higher learning, spread out throughout the country. The way they hype the importance of 10th board exams is sad. And the coaching classes are taking full advantage of it. 

My 10th board results stopped being useful once I got an admission in FYJC. I've grown up around people who often compared their kids to others and the first subject in hand is always to flex if their kid scored 90%. My parents have been really supportive though they never forced me to ""get better grades"" but I often felt I let 'em down which usually let to anxiety and depressing about the fact I'm no good.

To be honest I don't blame them marks are the only way around here to evaluate candidates for anything. Only if had been a more holistic evaluation but that's certainly out of the question because then only meritocracy will reign. I don't think everyone can  afford a school that emphasises on communication skills or everyone can buy a guitar just so to learn an instrument. Not giving freedom to children to pursue whatever they want is one of the main reason india is behind many countries in terms of innovation and in olympics.",Non-Political
"Why is learning programming the de facto advice in this sub?  [removed] I agree with you. There is life beyond, programming or JEE. Those one figured out way to deal with it, won't be asking questions here about options they have. We should engage more and give better solutions to young ones who are looking for the channels, avenues. 

One can become small town journalist, write stories, start printing wedding cards, electrician, plumbing, any kind of service sector with good level of social media reach Because that's what the majority of the sub's users are. They're all from an IT background. Their defacto advice is always that. randias advise : if you want to do something in free time , learn programming. If you have depression, hit the gym and delete Facebook. Also you shouldn't study engineering. Weird this post didn't get the traction. I need an answer too! Programming today is cool/looked upon like how speaking fluent or semi fluent English in 90's India was, it is a good touch to your portfolio. For majority of the non-cs and it branches core jobs related to their field are almost none. They pretty much end up in those mass it companies like tcs, so yeah that's why it is advised to learn programming as there is a high chance that you are going to end up on that path.

About other streams I don't really know. What other streams would you suggest? Hey, I think I am the one you are talking about. You can check my post history for verifying. 

I was specifically looking for coding advice because I love coding. I have completed python course from thenewboston, I know how use GitHub, I have account on stack overflow to clear my doubts and I am still doing a CS50 course whose sole purpose is to introduce students to computer science. I've written all this on post too. So, I am not sure you are specifically talking about me or not but if it's me, then I was looking for that advice, no one actually gave unsolicited coding advice to me Programming is high leverage. It's easy to learn. Most of the knowledge you need is found online.

I work in tech, and I've got no formal qualification other than 12th grade (I'm on a gap year after school). I'm also a part of an indie maker community, where it's fairly common to meet 16y/o kids who are self taught in almost every way bootstrapping startups, making good money. (Of course, software isn't the only pathway to this world and neither is it the only skill you need, but it's a good choice due to the high leverage it provides)

>Working in the software industry requires you to have formal knowledge about the underpinning of various technologies. And this can only be acquired by going through a formal curriculum.

Could you give me an example of such formal knowledge? I suspect someone who's motivated enough can pick up just about anything. Software happens to be a field without certain barriers to entry, like government certification which only graduates can apply for.

>Having a degree and internships is what leads you to a company

It's one metric, but not the only. Ultimately, employers want someone who's performant at a task, and can be responsible for it. Degrees prove your knowledge and intelligence, but these can be good replacements when you don't have one:

* have awesome side projects that demonstrate ability
* write good articles or record podcasts which prove your depth of knowledge
* communicate your existing skills well
* learn to spot opportunities early (ex: reach out to founders working on cool startups that aren't widely known yet)

&#x200B;

That's a non-exhaustive list. And of course, you can have those alongside a degree. I share this opinion too. Everyone seems to give similar advice and I can't understand why! What? I thought selling door knobs we the default advice here!

"2nd semester ending, No hopes for any internship [Need Guidance]  [deleted] good to see that you are emphasizing on learning new technologies in first year itself. unlike the  majority who keep mugging up just for grades There are 2 parts about Computer Vision. Theory and practice. Theoretical computer vision is quite difficult and requires a certain degree of knowledge in linear algebra as you mentioned. The practical part of it - not so much. You have OpenCV for that.

This is shallow but given that you're just in your first year, you should definitely try out OpenCV with Python. It's quite simple and the library has implementation for a lot of stuff. The problem with learning just the theory is that you don't see any reward and it's very difficult to continue. But if you make some software which does some cool stuff, albeit simple, you'd feel rewarded and you'd actually like to continue doing so.

So if you are really interested in learning computer vision, spend your 40-50% of time (that you spend learning linear algebra) in making things and rest of it in learning the theory. [deleted]",Non-Political

The question I hate the most in interview is ""why did you choose this project / why did you choose these tools to make your project?"". Man i chose these because I wanted to! Just preference. Just focus on your skills and any good company will eventually hire you. Don't feel intimidated by the job description, if you feel like applying for that particular job go for it. Be interviewed as much as  possible you can as it will only increase your confidence. It's programmer's market out there, so market is in your favour, negotiate your salaries keeping that in mind. If you got through the interview successfully, get to know the company and their top tech Management. Ask them what's their culture like, what tools they use for communication etc. Give importance to culture and people than to salary, it will go a long way in work satisfaction and overall happiness.

Yes, it is a small country with a population of 10 million (but more densely populated than India) and very poor too. But just have a look at how clean their capital city Kigali is. Not innovative, but a very traditional idea: recycle. There are nations that use more plastic than us, but recycle most of it, hence have less plastic pollution. 
Setting up recycling centres can be very useful in the long run.  [Make Roads](https://www.thebetterindia.com/43685/plastic-waste-in-road-construction-plastic-man-india-prof-vasudevan/) Firstly, all single use plastics should be totally banned. No plastic in food and beverage packaging. This itself will reduce a huge chunk of waste. In other cases, reusing should be encouraged, and if possible, enforced.  Plastic bags are a blessing to us poor to lower class people. I get a plastic bag when I buy some rice dal, eat rice on it using it as plate. Then take it to a water pipe and when no one is around I fill it with water. I wash my hands face and drink water. I throw it out after that. Some people use them to do latrine since they have blocked the defecation areas due to hybin issue. If the government could subsidize the manufacture of paper bags to the point it becomes cheaper than plastic bags, then we could probably have this problems solved. This would require some work to understand how paper bag can be maufactured at a lower cost. The only way to solve a problem like this is to incentivize the usage of other products. The root cause here is overpopulation. We need to spread out our settlements so that waste management becomes easier. With 10 million people in a city, it doesn't take much individual contribution to create a HUGE amount of waste.  Complete and strict ban on production, sale and usage of plastic. 1. Reduce-reuse-recycle. That's the sequence to manage all kinds of waste including plastics. 
2. Correct segregation of waste is the first step that needs to be taken care  at point of waste creation. 
3. The 3 bin method is the best for household waste. Wet (green waste 50-55% by weight), dry (recyclables 30-35%) and reject (hazardous10%). If waste is segregated at the household level it increases the recyclability, reduces the amount of weight going to the landfill. Green waste can ideally be composted locally.

Which branch you’re in? You can still move to pure sciences, lot of people have done it. For example, if you are in CS/IT, you can go for a masters in Statistics or Applied mathematics or Financial mathematics. All have good scope. Stats or applied maths will get you a great career in data science. Financial mathematics can get you a career in HFT firms or others as Quantitative Analyst but it’s tough to get into, you have to be really good at your maths.

If you are in other branches also, these fields are open. Applied physics is also good for niche careers especially if you have mech background.

"Short concise interactive books for college students. Indian education system in bad shape.  > the fragmented knowledge they get from internet , which is mostly pointless.

Gone are the days when you could curl up with a yashwant kanetkar C++ book and feel intelligent by proxy. Learning now has to be more chaotic - going back and forth between hands-on trials and theory. Who would want to begin with syntax and shit every single time.

I don't think an offline hard copy is feasible for as fluid a field as computer science. Textbooks are a racket even in USA.

Besides, computer Science and programming is not like physics or chemistry or biology where you can really benefit from a book. In those areas, the information is much more established and unchanging (or slowly changing).

HeadFirst series of books present info in an interesting way. But it can appear childish after 1 book. An online wiki is much more helpful. Or an ebook.  Education has to evolve, like any other field. Indian education system is still somewhere in the 70's. Absolute disregard for technology and still relying on dictation+ rote learning instead of providing a platform for students to develop their own individual skillsets. 

Trying to change it from within is quite futile. I'd say get out on time, do your 5 years of boring company work, then if you still feel strongly about it, innovate. Your current idea is very shortsighted, kind of a means to an end, which is what the industry terms ""a hack"".  You are relying on a non-existent community to collaborate and contribute to something, for which they have no motivation or incentive. 

Why not start a class forum or maybe a discord/slack group instead? Create a community on that, and let it grow over a semester. Recruit the people who are active there and think of a better solution. Sounds intriguing but hardly anything worthwhile can be covered in 100 pages, it won't be any different from a really good set of notes. The best books/teachers in my opinion explore the basics very deeply, they explore the shortcomings of previous theorems/algorithms/models leading to advanced theorems/algorithms/models.

Your qualms with the education system do hold true but don't just worry about clearing exams, find a subject area you are really interested in, explore and build an expertise around that.

Then may be his mother can manage for few months and meanwhile the student can pick up a part time job? I feel the best option here is:

- The student should move out of hostel and rent a house near his college.
- The mother should move in with her son here.
- Funds should be raised to support the expenses of both.
- As they are from an impoverished family, I am sure they know how to make do with whatever amount they have. 
- If the mother wants to work, I am sure the college too could be convinced to hire her as a temporary worker.

The mother just wants to feel secure and be with her son. This is the best way to go about it without disrupting his study. 

If you are not able to convince them, involve the educated community elders of the students family to speak with his family to let the boy pursue his education. As finance is the major concern, show them proof of how much their son can earn once he graduates.

"Our Robots (Mitra) Vs Their Robots (Boston Dynamics)  Theres a lot to unpack here. Technology like that requires SIGNIFICANT research. Which requires funding, infrastructure and most importantly people. We have a significant amount of brain drain where the aspirations of tLehe best and brightest is to go abroad for further research. Colleges in India aren't as  research focused as is required to truly build world class instutions. I studied in an NIT and the MTech students were treated very poorly and had to fight for even the most basic infrastructure.  Mitra was brought to my college. The mechanics, computer vision and the actual neural network all clearly looked terrible. 

It was no more a robot than a shitty little chinese  toy. It moved slowly (on wheels). It was capable of asking pre fed questions. It honestly looked like a remote controlled moving computer screen.

I cannot put into words how tatti it is.

Even trying to compare it to Boston Dynamics and others should be considered offensive. Mitra is not even worthy of being called a fuckin robot. Its a plastic toy. Balaji Vishwanathan, the famous Modi bhakt on Quora is its creator. No wonder they let this piece of plastic showcase in GES Hyderabad. It's embarrassing. Many people have called it out. https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7mf6d7/balaji_vishwanathans_mitra_robot_explained/ 1. There is no such thing as research or serious scholarship in India, barring some arts and humanities departments.

2. Teaching in STEM is a joke. Most professors and PhDs are not qualified to even take very basic introductory courses. It's an absolute shit show

3. Funding is abysmal. Resources are non-existent. Intellectual cultural or environment is absent. All this government cares about is vedic science.

4. Brain drain, yes, everyone with an ounce of potential and opportunity fucks off to abroad, because this country is hopeless. It's run by goons, full of outdated laws, unnecessary bureaucracy, lack of institutions that can foster scientific temperament and facilities.  

You want good things? You want India to be able to do stuff other countries so casually do. Look around you. Look at the poverty, and look at who is governing the country. Then wallow in your disappointment. 

It'll take another 50 years for Indian middle class to grow substantially that your aspirations becomes the aspirations of the average citizen, enough to shake the goon foundation of Indian politics and destroy it. 

Be glad ISRO at least capable of shit.  Mitra is surely not representative of Indian robotics. One of the reasons this robot gets so much attention is the undeniable fact that the founder Balaji Vishwanathan is a famous unapologetic hindutva sympathizer. Self marketing is something he does very well.  

That being said there are some really promising robotic startups that gets limited attention. Check out Grey Orange,  Sastra robotics and Asimov Robotics.  You got the name wrong, the name is not mitra its TATTI The answer is quite simple, India doesn't have money for *stupid* things like Science and Technology. Here is a [Nature article](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-01504-5?referral=true) describing India's abysmal stand over R&D:
> Despite the cash injection, India’s spending on science will remain relatively low, at around 0.8% of gross domestic product (GDP). That is well below the 3% that researchers demanded in August during ‘march for science’ events around the country. “There appears to have been only 8–10% rise in various scientific departments on average, which, factoring in inflation, is not much,” says Krishna Ganesh, founding director of the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research in Tirupati. “Nowhere are we even near 1% of GDP.”

I am doing Masters in USA after doing undergrad (from a reputed institute mentioned in the article) in India and I can see the difference quite well myself. Atmosphere is more conducive, funding is way higher and the most important: people at the top (politicians etc.) actually want to develop and explore Science  than do it just because they are in charge of that portfolio. Mitra is a kids toy at best. For ages 5-9. They can backflip too.
https://youtu.be/fRj34o4hN4I They're not even choosing the right products to show-off. While I admit that no Indian project has ever reached the level of Boston Dynamics we can definitely do something better than Mitra. Thousands of college students in the country are making things like [Mars Rovers](http://urc.marssociety.org/), [Race cars](http://www.formulabharat.com/) and fucking satellites which are more sophisticated than this thing.

"I am planning a new digital learning initiative. I need your help.  Count me in. I'm interested!  I have a few questions for you

1) do you have funding?

2) Are you going to be doing this full time? What about your higher education?

3) you're looking at a syllabus for all 12 years right from 1st standard?

4) platform? Mobile /PC /Web Hi, 

Amazing thought and it was wonderful to read your post and so much energy flowing into improving the quality of learning in our country. What you are thinking is absolutely right, how you would want to do it may require very serious consideration. You have to be very careful to not fall into the trap of what all has already been tried in the Indian education space. 

Honestly, what I have seen in the last 8 years with most organisations and inspired individuals like you is that they take a me too approach at solving this vast education problem in India. And that's one reason why we are yet to see one single solution reach mass scale. What we need is an integrated and a partnership driven approach to solve the problem at scale. 

I will give you an example to explain this better. 

When you talk to someone who wishes to transform our education, majority start talking about developing the content. What most don't understand is that there is so much content already available in English and in several local languages, across multiple subjects and grades. However, all content development is piecemeal. Which means that there is one company building apps on Math and then there is another creating animated videos in Science. Then, there would be someone who is working on assessments. And each one of them feels that their's is the best way to educate the child. Each one of them is trying to reach the same audience, albeit individually. To make content, you need lot of time, money and resources. And once you invest so much in making content, your only approach is to monetise that content piece and all your energies are towards this only. You therefore fail to see the larger picture. 

Second issue I have observed with educationists is that we end up giving too much structure to the way a child should learn. There is no space for the child to experiment and enjoy learning. You would know that historical learning gap is one of the major challenges in rural learning. A class 5 student cannot solve basic mathematics sum of class 2. A class 6 student cannot read words that a class 3 child should. And there is no way currently by which you can bridge this gap. By over structuring the learning and making it too teacher centric, we are depriving the child to happily switch to lower grades and cover up their basics. How can we expect a child to develop life skills that will help him grow. 

When we were starting[ iDream Education](https://www.idreameducation.org) after having worked in the education space for 6 years, we took a conscious call to take an integrated approach. We took years to go through multiple content pieces available and cracked the best way to integrate them, structure them and present them to a child under one dashboard. We have built a multilingual, personalised and an adaptive learning platform that integrates multiple categories of learning content from multiple sources thereby empowering each child to choose their own style and pace of learning.  We are taking a student centric approach to learning that also makes the life of a teacher much easier. 

What we have done so far is taken an integrated approach to content and the solution. The second part of the game is to create a channel to be able to reach schools and children at the lowest cost possible. A lot of organisations take a me too approach here also. Having learnt our lesson, we have chosen to take an integrated approach to building reach as well. We are therefore partnering with NGOs, aspiring education entrepreneurs and people who already running a school service and distribution business. The key is to build a sustainable and scalable business and social impact model that build both social and commercial value for everyone in the ecosystem. I have written more about the opportunity in the space of personalised digital learning [here](http://www.idreameducation.org/blog/social-business-opportunity-personalised-digital-learning/).

"Organisations like silverzone and SOF are ruining the prestige of olympiads in India.  Is it possible to enter Olympiads without being affiliated with a school? I was probably twice a bronze medallist in one of those SOF olympiads, science one - district level, sad to know all this. Also, anyone took the ASSET exam ? I still have that card with me Maybe I am in the minority, but as far I have seen, a good number of serious candidates actually know about the big 6 and the pointlessness of SOF Olympiads. At the very least, such serious kids also score well in NTSE/KVPY and other prestigious exams.

But it is indeed a sad state of affair that a lot of people haven't even *heard* of these. Two of my classmates gave the state qualifiers and went till the national camp but couldn't make it into the International tournament. I have given one of those fake ass IMO in my school where it is completely subjective with questions coming from the NCERT books. It completely felt like giving Pre-boards. 
  And at beginners level, if you want your kids to participate in any such olympiads (other than the big six), please avoid silver zone, SOF and eduheal. Go for unified council olympiads instead. They are somewhat better. And their BMA workbooks are far superior than the SOF workbooks. 

The big six can get very tough. I tried preparing for RMO but gave up in the preparation stage. It was hard for me. 

So please don’t force your kids to do that if they don’t have the aptitude. 

Also look for the government scholarship tests, they are reputable and prestigious and can give you an edge in admissions/jobs. Like NTSE, KVPY etc.  >Here's the kicker, the real IMO has never taken place in India since its inception, and only 11 people in India have won a gold medal.

Correction, [It has, in 1996.](https://www.imo-official.org/year_info.aspx?year=1996) Woah dude, your friend is a legend for getting a bronze in IMO. There was a Change.org petition which wanted to force these organizations to drop the word Olympiad from their name so as to preserve the name.


Also, slight clarification, India does participate in IPO and IESO (Philosophy and Earth Science). And IOL is just International Linguistics Olympiad. IMO took place in India in 1996 I believe !  Do you have any reliable resources regarding the big six Vs SOF?

I'm asking because my old school is a regular participant of the SOF Olympiads (heck, I came third in their English one. )

I could send that info to them so they could reconsider supporting them.  You forgot the junior Olympiads : IJSO and IOAA (Junior science and junior astronomy Olympiads).

**India must shed intellectual colonialism to excel in science and technology** 

 ______ 
There is a major power imbalance in the world, which comes from the language
that dominates the world of discovery, innovation, and science and technology.
Today, that language is English. The intellectual domination of the West comes
from the building of communities whose power comes from their deep connection
with their native language. The language which they use to think, dream and
shape the world is their own. This results in ideas that can change the world.
If you do not use or have a mastery over your native language in science and
technology, then, mere facility makes you a great follower and never a leader.

While overthrowing political and economic colonialism, we have failed to
overthrow intellectual colonialism. In making English the sole language of
intellectual discourse in science and technology in India, we have lost on
many fronts. First, exceptions aide, as a community even our best institutions
can never lead globally if English is the only language of high-level
intellectual discourse. Our best minds will merely be eloquent paraphrasers of
the ideas of others. Second, we close opportunities in intellectual leadership
to huge sections of our population. In other words, as intellectuals we cannot
be the best in the world. In addition to this, we lock the doors to even the
second- level positions we occupy as elites. One of the many consequences of
this is a poor connection of professional leadership with our society. Thus,
we fail in being great intellectuals, we exclude and do not share a sense of
purpose for society. In turn, our society responds to this elitism by
undervaluing learning and the intellectual enterprise.

There have been many examples of countries which have successfully addressed
the twin-challenges of developing communities of intellectual leaders in
science and technology and are yet deeply rooted in using their native
language for churning ideas. In Germany, science students would have had their
principal language as German and yet be fluent in English. Many of the best
German labs are international and the language of discourse may well be in
English, yet, the advantage that comes from the ability that German scientists
have to think in their native language, in the most advanced scientific
subjects, is not small. Conversely, no country, including India, that has
chosen English as its primary language of scientific discourse, ignoring its
local languages, has become an intellectual powerhouse.

Whenever there is a discussion on this subject, two arguments are made against
university education in one’s native language. The first is that English is
necessary in today’s world, which is valid. The answer is not to diminish
English, but to enhance the use of one’s native language at every level. The
second argument is that the task is impossible to implement. This argument is
both a cop-out and false. It is a cop-out because not taking this up forever
makes us an intellectual vassal-state, while maintaining an elite that is both
dysfunctional and disinterested. The argument is false because the task is
entirely feasible with focus and investment.

What, then, is to be done? Currently, the bulk of our college education in
science and technology is notionally in English whereas the bulk of our high-
school education is in the local language. Science courses in college are thus
accessible largely to the urban population and even when this happens,
education is effectively, neither of quality in English nor communicated as
translations of quality in the classroom. Starting with the Kendriya
Vidyalayas and the Nayodya Vidyalayas as test-arenas, we can ensure the
training of teachers so that students in high-school are simultaneously taught
in both their native language and in English. This already happens informally,
but its needs formalisation. The student should be free to take exams in
either language or indeed use a free-flowing mix. This approach should be
steadily ramped up and used in all our best educational institutions in
college and then scaled to be used more widely. Public and private colleges,
in STEM subjects, for example, can lead and make bi-lingual professional
education, attractive and economically viable. Technology, can of course
assist implementation, but the primary driver is a will to change.

Our international partners envy the facility many Indians have with English.
Without losing this, we must also have the ability to think deeply about
complex and difficult subjects at the level of the best in the world. This can
come only when communities in Rajasthan, Kerala or Odisha can wield, in their
minds, their respective languages in the frontier areas of science the way in
which the French, the Dutch or the Germans do. We should not conflate the use
of English as the vehicle for communication and commerce with the use of
language as the basis for the power of ideas.

consumption is higher than USA &amp; China's mobile data consumption put

Kant however, did not quote any source for the information.

In the recent past, India has witnessed a surge in mobile data consumption,
mainly with the introduction of

Reliance Jio

, which further led to competition in data plans among telecom companies.
Earlier this year, Reliance Industries chairman

Mukesh Ambani

had also claimed India's numero uno position in mobile data usage adding,"" Jio
users consumed more than 100 crore GB of data per month on the Jio network and
that's more than 3.3 crore GB a day.""

Earlier this week, a report released by investment firm Omidyar network
provided an insight to Indians' nature of mobile data use. The report claimed
that an average mobile internet user in India spends almost 70 per cent of the
time on apps like Facebook and WhatsApp, and music and entertainment apps.
This is much more than by people in the US, who visit these apps for only 50
per cent of the time they spend on the mobile phone. It further said that on
an average, a user in India spends 200 minutes a day on mobile apps, lower
than the US average of 300 minutes a day.

 FIITJEE is the most fucked up institute. Their math books start with equations. Like wtf. They know how to make simple things tough. They produce top rankers only because of large enrollment numbers and a handful of south Delhi teachers. I remember last time they referred 'Ram Rajya'.
Edit: I forgot about their mentions in Paradise papers. And yes these Institute do not teach science. Science is not sitting in a room and solving questions for two long year.

Last year I had to travel from Thrissur to Trivandrum in an ambulance. The driver was pretty fast and it was quite scary to look through the windshield. The vehicle had to turn and weave quite a lot because of the narrow roads. Our roads really need to be widened. I had driven the other way just the previous day in my car. Since the vehicles move for you when you are in a blaring ambulance, it does give you a perspective of how fast travel within Kerala could be with wider roads.  When we are ""we"" ,

"Unpopular opinion  While I would argue that lockdown was definitely needed to slow the spread, the handling of it was disastrous. It looks like the more important agenda for the Government is to come out of this with a good reputation and praise from International powers. They don't care about the ground realities. Extending the lock down further will only start negative repercussions, I think and hope they will lift it in the green zones next week. Jumlabaaz is copying China model without delivering food and other essential items at door steps. Lockdown has no meaning if we don't test.

Please provide a source for a 1% fatality rate when the healthcare system is overrun.

Again, no source. UNICEF estimates that around [8.8 lacs](https://theprint.in/india/8-lakh-deaths-india-unicef-report-child-mortality-2018/306950/) children die. And the number will also increase multifold if the healthcare system will be overrun. But you don't really care about them and are just using the stat to make a point.

Yes, an exit strategy is needed. And a lockdown was needed. It wasn't handled well but it was needed otherwise things would have been much worse right now.

Dealing with this was never going to be easy. The current government also has many flaws and the handling was definitely a car crash. But the argument that either you'll die from the lockdown or the coronavirus is a massive oversimplification of the situation.

Born in a typical marwadi family with strong RSS links, I grew up along the same lines, sharing pappu memes, Sonia and MMS conspiracy theories, despising muslims, perceiving modi as our God and what not.

My father, grandfather, we all are fed up of this guy all talk and no real groundwork for uplifting the citizens, the CAA NRC didn't help either.

\#chaddichandan >The Congress Party was always corrupt as hell, and whether you agree with me or not, it is my opinion that they win votes through a divide and conquer strategy. You separate people into different minority groups, then win their votes one by one.

While I agree congress was always corrupt to the core and never tried to improve upon it, I don't think I agree with the latter part, the divide and conquer strategy. If ever any minority voted for congress is not because congress asked support of minority, it was always because BJP backed up majority, so minorities felt left out and went with congress.

Edit: The BJP also didn't backup majority, they stand for their Hindu nation agenda and Hindus happen to be the majority. Despite corruption, congress never told citizens to live in a certain way. They were guilty of caste and religion politics but it was always means to an end. A thief finding ways to steal. For BJP/RSS, though, it's the end.

A few people here mentioned marwari background. I will urge you to read Gita press. Book is transparently biased but research is sound. I remember the old saying that  politicians, like underwear, should be changed often, and often for the same reasons.

We should probably keep changing our rulers every 5-10 years. But I also feel that along with the government, the opposition, civil society, media and people at large do have their role to play in the larger scheme of things. I personally dont believe in 'saviors' and I think we should judge our leaders objectively on the work they do, irrespective of their ideology or that of our own. 

We should hope that every subsequent government is just a little better than the previous one. That would be an achievement on its own. Bro I've been yelling distilled version of yours and other similar experiences. You and me, no gives a fokk. Political parties, main aim is to stay in power and make money. Someone riles up people about majority politics, the other on minority politics. More people need to wake up and enforce good governance. We have all the power we need but are kept distracted by this huge cacophony of vitriol about religion, region, language etc. 

Look around you, everytime a single misdeed is fortunately unearthed, the offending party gets down to miscolor it with something basic, outright stupid. Their lieutenants herd the populace inyonpro and against stance and we bicker like children, fueled by media baloney.

I am not siding with any so called political sect, but I hope someday, the real intellectuals and educated people come to the forefront and take control of governance as a demoracy is theoretically supposed to run. I appreciate your sharing your thoughts. BJP acts like Congress on steroids. The minorities know they have been sidelined by the national parties. It’s the majority that will decide in which direction the nation must head. There’s only so much hate that can be sown in people’s minds before the nation devolves into chaos. Hey man, I actually feel the same way and agree with most of what you have written. If I had it my way, I would have left this country for good long time ago. Just wondering , where were you born and live now ? All these demo gst etc were with good intention. But they backfired. All these schemes launched but indian didnt change overnight. Rather it setback. Even corona was unexpected. 

But still india is progressing. Its so much bettr now than 10-20 years ago. India of 2000-2010 is closer to rural india type. Now it has become highly modernised  in places where it should be  lik3 big cities etc. Look at punjab there is work but people want white collar job. People can warn enough money to meet daily basic requirements(not basic food but wide variety of exotic food) this was unheard of in small town or rural villages. In villages there is electrification water supply road acces to big cities.  People are getting  educated smarter earning more. They would spend more. This is just the beginning. No matter congress or modi. India should safeguard its progress. We are likr 20% soon we will reach 90%. You havent seen old india. There are layers in indian society. When the bottom layer gets educated enough they would get civic enough to understand their culture. Its just that basic need werent met now as we progress more people will eat better educate  their kids better and then there would be ideal socities. Compare india from past (1990s) to now. Look houlw much internet has made students smarter.  But alas youll only see majority who are enjoying the benfits but wont see the hard working people working on skills or education. These people are going  to be professionals. Dont worry india isnt going to become a hellhole. It always progressing. Its never stopped we dont have civil wars we dont have communal hatred we dont have riots. We may look like backward because we have just started. Remeber india invited foreign companies only in 1995s because they didnt want most population to go jobless. India would rather employ 100 people than automate. But its capitalism is changing these things fast. Visit india from a upper class educated point of view. Youll see that if you forgot about soo many people who are unskilled and getting then youll see india which would be a no better than a eastern european country in terms of richness but very strong culture.

To answer your question, I was literally shitting bricks. So... not very well. I would do my best to avoid any COVID test in the first place due to quarantine conditions. The only situation in which I end up in quarantine would be if I show symptoms so severe I cannot manage with OTC medicines , but there is still a chance of survival via a hospital treatment If you are covid positive, government may force you to move to quarantine centre.

"Unpopular Opinion: As someone who is not a BJP voter, I begrudgingly admit that the centre government's response to Covid has been as good as any central government could've given  I was reading old newspapers. The 1^st February Business-Standard has ""Economic Survey 2020: GDP to grow 6-6.5% in 2020-21"" on first page  and ""Coronavirus reaches 22 nations"" on the last page. That quite sums it all up as to what the government did.

Both Economic Survey and Budget 2020 don't have one sentence mentioning the virus. I then realised one thing: people who can't foresee 1 month in advance with all data available are expected to foresee the whole year with no data available. You're seeing the glass as half full; nothing wrong with that. However, there is another perspective too. I suck Congress dick every morning, and I shamelessly claim this government has no clue and shit is going to hit the fan.

There's no actual plan to get out of this situation. We are stopping the lockdown only to reimpose it later all those who think lockdown won't be reimposed are serious retards living in their own fantasies. People are starving from hunger, that's why lockdown is reopened. Govt promised pulses etc didn't reach even 20% of the beneficiary population, our PDS has failed us again.

DO NOT STEAL CREDIT FROM THE WORKING CLASS. I think an important point that people are forgetting and failing to highlight is that we KNEW what covid19 could do to lives and the economy but the government chose to delay its response till after half of March was over. 


Countries like New Zealand and Australia nipped the outbreak in the bud while the Central government chose to ignore the advice of medical professionals which came in as early as February 27th that the temperature checks at airports would do nothing to filter in asymptomatic carriers from abroad.

"Hypocrisy of indian govt. cutting salaries of employees while ordering private sectors to retain all employees on payroll  Kerela government will be cutting salaries of government employees for next five months. All states (and central government) are cutting corners wherever possible. At least salaried people are getting most of their salary with a small cut. Small and medium businesses selling non-essentials have basically zero income these days. There is no guarantee that they may recover in upcoming days and I fear many will have to close their business or go bankrupt. Yes, I was thinking along the same lines. With the kind of business ecosystem this Government has provided for SMEs, they have no right to bring such ridiculous rules. Big corporates can afford to sustain this due to the reserves they possess. Small companies cannot adhere to such practices and why should they? Having said that, I think paying salary during the lockdown is fair because it was just a month and a half. But expecting companies to not lay off someone if there's no business or revenue for an extended period is just idiotic. We are suppliers to automotive companies you can understand our business has turnovers but profitability is not much. It is a labor intensive industry with high overheads. As much as we want to we can’t sustain salary expenses with no revenues. There is no cash flow. Are we supposed to give salaries till we finally go bankrupt.

This article shouldn't be in the Islamophobia list.

Reason: 
I have seen this Live TV, A Relative of mine works at Bhadrachalam Temple Board. 
They had only a mini celebration, they didn't allow pilgrims Only working staff were allowed. Its a ritual that had to be followed and it was done under tight scrutiny. 
Don't just randomly link stuff to Islamophobia. Anyone can write articles, that dosen't necessarily mean its the only truth. Some have false narrative behind.

This happened especially after the Tabligi incident and media was also eager to post Hindu violations. The Print and Quint had this false narrative so please do recheck with local or other news. 

 I understand your well intentions, but his isn't  a good one to make a point. 
Thanks OP. When Kanika Kapoor did her nautanki, people were absolutely ruthless in their abuse directed at her. I remember in early March lots of vitriol being directed towards NRIs for being virus-carriers. There was also a huge amount of abuse towards one lady who allegedly fled from Bengaluru to Agra after learning her husband has corona virus. That news turned out to be fake. But there is no mainstream word like ""NRI-phobia"" or ""Kanika-phobia"". 

The public anger has a lot to do with Islamophobia. But I also think the larger public anger has something to do with these facts you are silent about

a) Foreigners hiding in mosques across India after having attended Tablighi Jamat

b) Stone pelting and attacks on health workers arriving to quarantine/trace contacts of those who attended (yes, 90% of these reports are fake, but these 10% happened. I know of 2 such incidents in my native place Bengaluru itself. Happened in Indore, Surat, Madhubani (Bihar), Moradabad). 

This Tablighi Jamat is already responsible for a large proportion of the cases in Indonesia, Malaysia and Pakistan as well. People are calling even references to Tablighi Jamat as promoting Islamophobia. In the initial days weren't all corona +ve cases identified by ""travel history to Italy"" or ""travel history to China"" etc.  So similarly I see nothing wrong in listing the source as Tablighi Jamat for many cases. Better than ""single source"". 

If I'm not mistaken, a gurudwara function was also responsible as being a super-spreader (you can search and add that to your little list). But this was localised to Punjab. I'm sure if the contacts of those who attended that meet also had returned to places all over the country and pelted stones, spit on and misbehaved with health workers, people wouldn't be saying very nice things about Sikhs either. The people going overboard with the Tablighi Jamat stuff (bio-jihad, etc.) are those who anyway keep demonising Muslims. Why should I, a common citizen, not be annoyed at members of this group for their actions, some which were maybe inadvertent (I don't want to get into the controversy of whether the meets were held before or after Kejriwal's ban on gatherings and all that) but after that has been a very poor behaviour? I don't buy all these excuses that oh they're poor, ill-informed, WhatsApp rumours, don't trust the state blah blah. There's no excuse for violence, especially when it can jeopardize public health. I think this list misses all that and pretends that the reason for the anger is Muslims gathering. It's more than that One standard for me, another for thee

[removed] wow this is super low karma whoring. This is good and helpful. Nice work. It would be good to have a substantial list. It will not change all minds, but it gives some substance for quiet conversations and reflection on our biases.

There are tens of millions, if not hundreds of millions, in groups and communities doing the thing and contributing to find a way out of this crisis. Demonizing entire communities on the basis of the actions of a few is not wrong, inappropriate and not helpful to a resolution. I request the mods to sticky this so that others can contribute as well. Because once the Muslims come on the street to celebrate Eid, the chaddi chors are gonna bhow-bhow again.

"The real loser in India's errupting Islamaphobia: Caste politics.  I understand everything you say except 

> But the fact remains that Modi's government has done spectacular work for the backward communities (barring muslims). We in urban areas scoff at the Modi governments but their work for the financially weak and socially disadvantaged has been phenomenal. From being called ""Congress + Cow"" it has been jokingly called ""Prakash Karat + Cow"". Such is the success of Modi's socialist policies that I have to begrudgingly accept it as the unequivocal truth.

What exactly are these policies? Real problem is fake news. Most people aren't smart enough to check facts by themselves. I think for a long time in this country, there was a belief that the 15% Muslims have a veto on who rules India in BJP circles. I think there is a quote by Balbir Punj, former BJP MP saying the same. 

The thing is that although as you say 85% of Indian Muslims are backward classes, the whole community itself was almost a single monolith when it came to voting preferences. 

Coming to some specific parties, say Mulayam Singh. As the family becomes powerful, it looses focus and becomes a Yadav party and all other OBCs leave. Same for Mayawati. As she becomes all powerful, Jatavs become powerful. All others leave. 

BJP, has in fact given tickets to the non Yadav OBCs and non Jatav Dalits in a significant number. What BJP has done at the same time is create the most loyal caste base India has seen: Upper caste Hindus. They will vote BJP because they are scared of everyone else. 

The opposition is not without blame for this. When you constantly 24/7 call BJP a Hindu party screaming at the top of your lungs, you are literally begging the Hindus to vote BJP.

Conclusion: I don’t think the caste politics is dying. It’s just that it’s been played in a different way which seems more efficient. 

P.S.  this is just a discussion. Do not take anything too seriously I don't agree with the ""government uplifting backward classes and hence getting the votes"" part. Most of the policies, as already mentioned by others, predate this government. Furthermore, most of them are either pure disaster(DeMo), mismanaged policies with potential(GST), or did very little compared to how hyped up they were(swaccha bharat, ujjawala). MNREGA, beti bachao beti padao and the likes existed even in UPA era, and were better funded than now.

Poverty literally increased under modi, so did unemployment, and income inequality. I should remind you that UPA under Manmohan uplifted record number of people after poverty in a decade, a record only second to china, farmers too, which constitute most of the backward people in India did far better under Manmohan. 

What's getting them vote is organised hatred they spread online. Indian people are gullible, and BJP were quick to capitalise on that. People don't question the policies because they don't see the government as the problem, the media and the IT cell have given people other enemies to blame in trying times- Muslims, Congress and Pakistan. 

I should add, if you think upper castes think any better of the backward ones now, you're wrong. Nobody's enlightened, they just have a bigger enemy for now.  If hypothetically, muslims were removed, the caste system will reach it's former glory in no time. Pleasantly surprised to see a post like this identifying that a majority of Muslims are indeed erstwhile so called lower caste pedigree. 

Goes to strengthen my view that there aren’t really religions in India but castes, castes and castes. 

That out of the way, the lower castes are - by design - kept under educated and under represented that very few realise they’re being used. Example: https://www.telegraphindia.com/culture/books/book-review-i-could-not-be-hindu-the-story-of-a-dalit-in-the-rss-by-bhanwar-meghwanshi/cid/1765671

In Karnataka, for example, many towns have a colony called a “A K colony”. The A K denotes a caste and as opposed to an “agrahaara” which are usually a Brahmin stronghold, the AK colonies are typically a stronghold of a particular low caste often reflecting the gross neglect over time as well. 

These places - and others like it - have always had high unemployment. All of this is a complete package you know. It’s extremely hard to get out of. Anyway, in these places the testosterone fuelled unemployed youth are usually up to no good. Given no support system and discrimination outside and all. Back then they were used by the powerful as henchmen or for other dirty work. Now they’re still used by the powerful but the new powerful are all consolidating under the Hindutva label. 

The caste system is so uniquely ubiquitous in everyday life that the privileged bubble inhabitants can’t even begin to fathom the “world building” that invoked if it all were presented as a novel.

There are some unique castes - typically the erstwhile landowner class. Who’ve since graduated to owning large institutions, businesses and so on. You know, grown up, productive stuff. I have so much awe for how they look after their own and the sort of support system they’ve developed for themselves which allows even for the “underperformer” amongst them to achieve something in life that he or she may feel proud of.

This almost never happens in the case of a lower caste disadvantaged person. The rare ones who do happen to break out of it - if they were lucky enough to get some sort of support in the form of reservations _and_ familial, financial support and have the fortitude to survive the education system without being discriminated against. They still face an uphill struggle wherever they end up working at. More so if it’s a government workplace. 

If they excel and do better than their peers they’re subject to allegations of having cheated and get corruption cases filed against them. And after having to face all of this shit in their career are left with little to no wherewithal to be what they wish they had when they were young - a mentor, godfather or a role model to their own “kind”. Just like in the other powerful castes, ahem, “communities”. 

And that’s where the current _shaaka_s are capitalising on. Catching them young. Keeping them dumb. Not letting them rise. Making them hate each other and the Muslims who’re no different than they are. Driving away the “missionaries” who come with an education package. 

A core feature of a hierarchy is that it is designed to always make anyone who’s not at the very top nor at the very bottom to have someone to feel superior to. And those at the lower ladders are at a double whammy position where they’re not enlightened enough to realise the harm they’re doing unto themselves by being part of some of the heinous crimes you hear of in places like TN.

Anyway, it’s a shit show. I’m envious that a majority of the caste denying elitists here don’t have to see or imagine any of this and live their grand privileged lives envying that one SC guy who drove a BMW. 

No political party every stands for them. KA has had exceptional leaders from such castes for decades and they’re _never_ allowed to rise up. It’s by design. Nobody can break out of it. Your analysis is quite correct , and the reason Islamophobia is growing because many lower caste ar getting educated and thanks to propaganda they are likely to see Islam more of a threat compared to Brahminism.

 A small example of how Manusmriti ideology has even engulfed Dalits.

I happened to meet One of my batchmate who used to be a torched bearer of Ambedkarism in our university ( we both are Dalits).
I was shocked to see idols of gods and the blatant karmkand things in his house which he used to vehemently oppose.

I just asked him that what happened to you in all this year's .

His reply was ' Ye Buddhism Jai bhim wagerah mein maaza nahi hain , kya milta hai Buddhist banke ,enjoyement apne hindu religion mein hi hain, I got so many things when I started following hindu religion. Jai bhim banenege toh koi bhi festival nahi hain. ,Kya matlab uska.

I just told him that your job, degree is only because several decades back a man fought for it with the establishment ,if not for him you would be  sewering in a gutter and doing what you are supposed to do.

Many backward castes which have become affluent due to capitalism post 1990s are more hindus and more casteist than the Brahmins , like Yadav's , Gujjars, Marathas who are more indulged in caste based atrocities compared to the Brahmins . I think you make valid points regarding (a) why BJP has gained the reserved seats; and (b) caste politics has been overshadowed by the unifying hatred against the Muslims.

We all probably agree with u/Android5511 that the reason for (b) is not so much the effective implementation of welfare schemes but the successful deployment of polarising techniques by BJP and its media cohorts. That said I find their optimism that Modi-lahar might wane slightly misplaced for three reasons: (i) there is no indication that these polarising techniques have lost their efficiency; (ii) as the present pandemic has given the Center sweeping powers, regular administrative functions and even botched operations are now going to be touted as Modi's achievements; and (iii) the voting behaviour in state elections can be the opposite in central elections, case in point Jharkhand which they refer to.

Another shortcoming which I find in the print commentariat as they try to understand why Dalits vote for BJP is the shallowness of their analyses. Best exemplified by Dilip Mondal's article that you linked, they fail to answer why is it that Dalit voters, especially in urban areas, don't rally behind radical Dalit leaders. It would require a much lengthier write-up, but I suspect that it is the lure of savarna ethic and the success of capitalism which they are led into believing, owing to the constant media propaganda and the ineptitude of parliamentary Left in India. Please note that I am not saying the savarna ethic is worth emulating or that capitalism is actually successful, quite the opposite I would say. But such is the hegemonising power that the cultural elite have, a point noted by Gramsci and successive others.

The savarna ethic is a self-replicating one, a virus. One can see that many OBCs and many Dalits become strident defenders of Brahmanism once they acquire a certain degree of social mobility. Led into thinking that their emancipation is because of the savarna ethic, and not despite of it, many try to abnegate their Dalit identity itself. The same can be said about capitalism; it is the lure of this heady cocktail of Baniya capitalism that fuels India and shapes Dalit politics (outside the safe spaces of universities) today.

"What happened to the Congress? Want to gather thoughts and opinions about this for research.  Congress isn't evolving with time. When Shashi Tharoor entered politics, he took to social media platforms and was one of the most followed leader on twitter but the old horses of Congress rebuked him for that. Cut to 2014 and ever since then, BJP took hold of that space and undertook relentless campaign against opposition in which they have stooped so low as to making personal remarks against any and every leader.


I, and many more people like me, even if they hate BJP to the core,  wouldn't make any objectionable remarks against Modi's wife but that doesn't stop the right wing followers from furthering their vilification campaign so technically you just can't match their level of propaganda because if you do end up coming down to their level to defeat them, they still win.

Congress isn't willing to change its leadership and that has just continued to cost them everything. LS elections were a shitshow for them because in a competition of Rahul vs Modi, you can't expect a person on fence to crossover towards Rahul courtesy partially his own goof ups and partially the edits the IT cell makes to make him look much more stupid than he actually may be. Their wins in assembly elections have all been because of the state leaders but even there they managed to fuck up by sidelining the likes of Pilot and Scindia just because they can't think beyond their veteran leaders.

I'm sure there are many more reasons but these are what I could think of. Obviously some or even all of my opinions may be wrong but this is my understanding of the situation. Only an online war against BJP IT cell could bring in any change Congress has no head. Ever since Sonia G got ill and put her son in charge, it has gone down in terms of power and even in voice. The once strong party that ruled the majority has been reduced to mere crackles that you hear every now and then. Veteran leaders who have experience and ability to lead are being shunned behind the 'leadership'. The son doesn't have experience and has never really been in charge of affairs up until recently. He has been contesting elections from Amethi which is by far one of the worst or the worst performing constituency in the country. He really wasn't groomed to lead the party from the get-go. So now you have a nobody who's where he is because he's the boss' kid. Other than that he has no credentials, no track record, no experience. The Congress has folded due to their own incompetence and poor decisions. It's sad really. Nothing happened, which is the problem. Unless  they start to look beyond a Gandhi/Vadra leadership, BJP will continue to get away with murder. Has no leader. Modi is too popular to be defeated. Also there's a lot of distrust about Congress due to a very corrupt + inefficient UPA 2.

"So, I'm an American dating a South Indian, and I need some advice  Every human being is different, so please take my generalized advice with a pinch of salt:


There's a strong division in Indian society between what is public and what is private. Please know that these conceptions are not universal and do not overlap exactly with American ideas. In many Indian communities, dating is now common in the younger generation, but telling your family about a significant other = an engagement. So in an Indian context, for many people, its putting the cart before the horse to announce the relationship prior to an engagement.  
If your relationship is strong in every other way, a reluctance to tell the extended family does not signify a lack of belief in it on her part. Assuming your relationship is in good shape in every other way, she isn't ""hiding behind"" Indian culture, she's doing her best to balance her family's worldview with your worldview, and this takes time and effort. Many people who have to inhabit multiple worlds go through this process. 

Perhaps one way to proceed is to get on her team, become her partner and ally in negotiating between cultures. After all, once you marry an Indian, you've joined the wild and subtle dance of inhabiting multiple cultures for life, my friend.  So ask questions, something like:

- What does your family think about X?
- What can we do to set them at ease about X?
- How can we communicate to them that XYZ is important to me/us?
- What is important to them / what are their concerns about X?

Get yourselves on the same team, so that you're not another node in the cultural tug-of-war. 

Once more, every person and every relationship is unique, and so is every family, so take my thoughts with a pinch of salt. Dude. I’m an Indian girl engaged to a non indian, and half my family still doesn’t know. Trust me, it’s less drama this way. Ask her if her mom is against the extended family knowing. How does she plan to break the news of the marriage to them? How old are you both? I'm from Coimbatore and it's still a very conservative place compared to other big cities. Her reservations about revealing about you to her family could be because of two reasons. Most families here are not very encouraging of love marriages and doubly so when it's interracial. She may be holding off because she doesn't want the extended family making unwanted remarks about her relationship. It is not unusual for the family to reveal to others in the extended family about the relationship only after the wedding dates are set. In a conservative South Indian set up there's only courting no dating. 

Also she may not be very sure of what the future holds especially since you guys may end up living in different cities. And if it doesn't work out, if she has to get an arranged marriage then if her extended family knows about a prior relationship with an American her value in the arranged marriage market goes down. You need to ask yourself this first. Is it really necessary for you to want her extended family to know about you?
Over here in some conservative communities , extended family will poke their huge noses in EVERY matter. I'm not exaggerating by any means. It is a nuisance . Imagine them calling you everyday and asking why you don't have kids and then making fun of you for not being a ""man"" and earning more than his wife. They will berate you . Your partner is aware of that and is trying to tread carefully here . So understand her side, know that this is a serious situation and give her time to deal with this . Also take some time to brush up on her family politics lol A lot of Indian families are very close knit, children (even after 18) are close with their parents and often support them financially too. Parents too support their children, emotionally and financially.

Here are a few things you need to consider.
- Find out how close is she to her family
- How orthodox is her family, immediate most importantly.

If she's really close and is from an orthodox family, you're definitely in for trouble. Reason being it's quite likely they would want an arrangement within the faith and even possibly the same language. That being said, if she's not really close she may still be okay going against their wishes. But if she is really close, 99% chance she will not go against their wishes. Though you've probably been told this, marrying someone from another country, heck, even just a slightly different community then your own is a HUGE deal in India. Having a job and being independent would give her more standing and give her decisions (like deciding to marry you) more weight and respect in the community. My cousin was dating his gf for about 6 years (who was also from India but from a different state) before he told his parents because he was waiting to get a good job. When I told my parents about my girlfriend who was Indian but was Christian, there were fights and tears for several months and my own mother couldn't talk to me for an entire month. This despite the fact that we're comparatively a very progressive family, with several relatives including myself living abroad. And all this is exponentially harder for a girl because India is still quite patriarchal and women asserting their independence can cause major freakouts. 

So please realise that this isn't about YOU. You don't have to convince her of anything or explain to her how important it is to you etc etc. She already knows all these things. And she agrees with all these things. She is on your side. However, the careful manoeuvres required to inform parents and extended family... Leave those decisions to her. She has taken the first steps which is telling her sister and her mother. My guess is her mother is still getting acclimatized to the idea. And before she tells her father she would need her mother's support. If mother's support is there, even if her father gets upset she (your gf) will have someone on the inside (her mom) to placate him. Otherwise things could get ugly fast. 

Again it's not about you at all. It's unfortunate that Indian families are like this. But these tight family bonds lead to a much more supportive, connected and loving family structure once all this blows over and you won't regret it. It's just that some people are old fashioned and need some time to come to terms with big changes. All their life her parents probably had ideas on what her wedding would be like or what kind of groom they will find for her and they have to suddenly make a 180 on the things they've simply believed all their lives.

Similar issues will arise when her parents want to tell the rest of the family. There are a lot of things they will consider. Things like timing and maybe first slowly introducing the idea that she's dating someone without revealing who it is. They may also want to go in person to have this discussion. In the case in my family each move was very carefully planned and we aren't even particularly close or dependant on the extended family. 

If you want to make things easier for her, make some efforts to understand her culture. Learn a bit of the language, buy some traditional Indian clothes (with her help!). Read up on Indian history so you better understand the context of some things. And make sure to support her when she starts facing push back (which she 100% will) from her family and extended family. People may say awful things about her to her face, stuff that makes her cry. Your job is NOT to get angry at that moment or say something like ""fuck those guys how dare they say that"" and try and break away from the family. Instead be patient and give it time, lots of time. Be like a river that carves its way through a canyon. Just with patience and time you can win over even the most conservative folks in her family. But she has to be the one taking these decisions on how to move the needle forward. Just trust her and wait. About the job thing, there isn't anything extra you can do. She knows it's important too, but far more important things are on the line, lifelong family relationships and she definitely has to prioritize that. If she messes it up, both the job and the relationships get fucked. She must be smart enough to know that this stuff is time sensitive, she's struggling with these decisions as well. I can't imagine there is anything you can tell her she hasn't thought of already. I am a guy who is born and bred in [Coimbatore.In](https://Coimbatore.In) the last 4-5 years,i am seeing comparatively a lot more Indian guys/girls are getting married to non indians than ever before.Chill,my only advice is to let her know how much she means to you .Don't fret too much about being being accepted to her extended family and let her""the coming out"" part to her.

One tip is once things get settled ,get a hang of things what you can say or not to say from [her.In](https://her.In) India,typically value if your parents have had a strong and long relationship and fret if you have step moms/dads taking it as a sign of you not being brought up properly or not marriage material.Another one,is fold your hands and greet elders with a ""Vanakkam"" for extra brownie points I'm dating a non-indian so maybe I can offer some perspective. I've met his family. Several times. They were very sweet people and we loved each other a lot. Nobody in my family is even aware of his existence. I cannot even begin to imagine the drama if I tell them. I am pretty serious about him, and I do plan to tell them someday once my bf gets a job and settles down but for now? I definitely don't wanna deal with that bc Indian parents + relatives are The Most annoying people on the planet. 

It's not a you problem it's a them problem. It's better off that you tell them as late as possible once everything (like ur wedding date etc) is set, or better yet, not tell them at all. 

Tbqh, I don't hold my relatives in high regard and I'd prefer they never knew of my boyfriend even after he becomes my husband. It does create some friction that he's never met anybody on my side, but I do try to emphasize that these people don't matter that much to me. Maybe u should consider why it's so important to you that her family needs to know about you. Like I get it if u have a really good relationship with ur family, and maybe she doesn't get along with hers. In that case she wouldn't want them to tell them at all. You are asking relationship advice on a forum where 99% of the population have never had contact with the opposite sex. Have patience, wait a while.

"Since some people actually believe Mamata is worse than Modi, lets's see how she compares to the other CM candidates from the other parties of the state.  >Unfortunately 9 years is too short a time to right what happened over the past 60 years.


Same excuse the bhakths giving for Modi.


I like your interesting take on Mamata where you've conveniently ignored the following:


1. Corruption - Only Mamata bhakths believe that she and her party members had nothing to do with the Sarada scam. Or the other chit funds. The cases are still pending and the money is totally gone. Whatever money was returned to the few was taken out from the state funds. A bridge collapsed in the middle of city and tmc government didn't bat an eye. Trifala scam has started again. There's too many to list here, but do check what Abhishek Banerjee has been doing for the last few years. 


2. Intolerance - Calling students Maoists and arresting them. Arresting professors and putting them behind bars without fair trial for posting a simple meme. Police violence in JU. Torturing civil service officers to suicide. 


3. Lies and Jumla - park street rape case. The accused escaped and his gf who aided his escape was taken into the party. Mamata assassinated the character of the rape victim just to give a clean chit to the accused. Everyone forgot that it seems. In this regard, care to elaborate what's she's doing with the covid 19 testing to hide the numbers? Social media is rife with tells of how people are being turned away from hospitals, and that's not bjp propaganda. I'm receiving news from my friends who are doctors that there's state sponsored propaganda to hide the numbers. Mamata even went as far to forcefully audit the deaths to co-morbid conditions so that the covid report can be suppressed. Funny thing is, unless there's co-morbid conditions, you'll not even die from covid, that doesn't mean it's not spreading.


4. Industrial output - pray tell what Mamata has done to improve the state's industrial output? Where are the jobs? We've all been hearing the empty lies from the biswa bangla summit, how many of the those projects ever came to fruition?


5. Minority appeasement - while Modi is trying to get rid of muslims, Mamata is doing the opposite, going as far as to ignore the criminal elements in the society to pander to that votebank. The attack on doctors that sparked a protest across the country was fueled by the simple fact that Mamata didn't have the guts to arrest the criminals because they were Muslims, even when the rational Bengali Muslim community tried denouncing them over and over. She has given the statement that those who came from Bangladesh and have voted are now citizens even if they have come recently, what the fuck? Mamata doesn't get to decide who gets citizenship. We don't want Bangladeshis here, no matter if they are Hindu or Muslim. Her government had even shielded war crime convicts just to get some brownie points. Why?


There's no difference between Modi and Mamata except the fact that while the first one is trying to get rid of the Muslims, the second one was trying to alleviate them to a godlike status (one imam from a Bengali masjid gave the statement a few years ago that the Muslims will decide who gets to become the CM of WB). Other than that, the lies and jumla are just as widespread, the corruption just as deep. The only reason Mamata gets away with all this is because Bengal has became irrelevant in the national stage. No one gives a shit. Else she's just as corrupt and authoritarian as Modi. And if talking about the developments, these are all being done with a single strategy. Destroy Bengal's industrial output, evict all the educated folks, so whoever left becomes solely dependant on the state for their livelihood. Meanwhile she and her goons can continue ruling the state like the left has done for last 3 decades. That's all there is to it.


Bengali's have no hope left. It's TMC or BJP, and both are cancerous in their own ways. Only chance is for an Arvind Kejriwal to rise, but that's probably never gonna happen. Most educated and literate bengali's are leaving the state, who's gonna rise to the occasion? There should be a trade off between socialism and Capitalism.

Something in between so everyone can benefit. [deleted] Nice writeup bro. 

How’s the popularity of BJP among Bengalis ? I heard they are gaining ground in some spots and local polls . 

Do you think communists supporting the BJP will affect TMC much ? Okey let's list pros and cons of Mamata and TMC

Pros: 1) Mamata is authoritarian but still TMC regime is way more free than the previous CPM rule. It was possible to openly post against TMC in social media. Such open criticism of the government or party was impossible for most people earlier.

2) Rural infrastructure is developed a lot in comparison to previous regime. Roads are improved a lot.

3) The police and the government offices are more active.

4) Smaller crimes like eve teasing and theft are reduced in my experience.

5) The government and the party is secular and not racist  at all which is a big plus point in todays India.

6) Economy of the state is improved.

7) Government officials and police has more power than the previous regime where they were puppets of the local party office.

Cons: 1) One woman party and government. Due to her tendency to control everything her government is full with people who are good for nothing and totally useless. She doesn't like people who would argue with her.

2) Her intolerance against opposition.

3) TMC is full with goons and politicians whose sole aim is to make money by hook or crook.

4) ""Appeasement"" of big groups of people for vote. Yes, not only Muslims, she tried to appease every groups who are united enough. The all India media do not show her ""appeasement"" of Hindu Matua people who are a big votebank. She tried to appease both Mullahs and Brahmin Pandits by offering them money. She also gave money to clubs and durga pujas.

5) Various scams like Sharada, Trifala etc.

6) State government employees are angry with her due to  not giving DA and other allowances at par with the central.

7) Reduction of government employments and some questionable recruitments.

Verdict:

TMC is still better than Bengal BJP which is openly anti muslim, anti science, anti intellectual,pro fake news and anti- Bengali. Good write up.  Mogambo khush huya. [removed]",Politics

"Why is the Modified Media continuously playing the same propaganda themes again and again? It is by design not by chance. Here are some thoughts on this  I've often wondered if such strategies would work with liberal propaganda. Does blasting the cow belt with liberal principles in hindi 24x7 turn them into liberals? I suspect not. Ideas like communal harmony and scientific temper were broadcast using similar principles from the 50s to the 90s but didn't turn Indian masses into rationalistic liberals. The brainwashing seems to work only with ideas which encourage the darker sides of people. Very good analysis. Very impressive. How do think it will play out, say 5 to 10 years. First demographics. Religious wise there are 15% Muslims, around 18 to 20 crores. While in Germany in hitler's time minority/jews were less than 1 percent. No Internet at that time. So people were getting only what government was selling them while in todays time people are getting both sides of the story. Although mainstream media is getting more views. But even then bjp has lost a lot of states. In Delhi they has done everything they could in their power but lost. But it surely is working. Bjp/RSS has always been doing that and they were staying in power with that. But what's the end of the line here. Where it will go. Also there are 20% Dalits who don't agree with rss ideology. So lets say 15+20=35, leave 5%. So there are at least 30% who will never agree with them because of obvious reasons. When BJP lahar came, their election slogan was sabka sath sabka vikas. But now everyone knows that it's not like that. They are still in power. Communal agenda is still being fed, it's not necessary that enough people agree with how things are. Absolutely no vikas and eveyone who's not their saathi is their enemy. These are just some points which gives me hope. Really would like to know your opinion on the question, how it will play out in 5-10 years.

"What do you think can be reason for less coronavirus cases in India as compared to other highly populated Asian/western countries?  Our per capita testing is quite low (around 230 per million people). Countries like South Korea (10,460), USA (9784) and UK (4865) have much higher, just to name a few. If we raise our testing capacity significantly, I expect much more alarming numbers. Lockdown, also Italy, Spain and USA had many missteps

Eg. Kerala already had a plan in place from 3rd Feb, odisha appointed 1000 docs on march 8. And so on 1. India's testing rate till now has been pathetic. 

2. India initiated a strong lockdown in the early phase itself. 

Factors like survivability of virus at high temperatures have not yet been well researched. 

However, I think it would be premature to discuss this issue based on the current number of cases. According to worldometers, the number of test done by India is 220 per million, so lack of testing could be the case for lesser number of individuals ""tested"" positive.

[Here is the link.](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries) What you don't count, you don't know. Luck. 

We are not favorite destination for Chinese tourists.  
Also the number of Chinese working in India are low. 

Chinese new year is a biggest gathering of Chinese in their home country. Outbreak coincided with the event. 

So the people who went home to China during new year went back to their work after nye. 

As the pathogen travel from person to person , the numbers along  tourist circuits and people returning to work from China blew up.

All clusters are  directly or indirectly associated with large gatherings or tourist networks .

Edit: which spared us from first phase , where there are lot of unknowns. A genuine question. If we actually had much more cases than what is being reported, then shouldn't we have a lot of people dying? No concrete reason for it yet. Virologists can't find a definite pattern on many things related to this virus as the virus is pretty new comparatively. So, it is early to conclude anything on the number of cases other than increasing the testing which alone can give a better idea on the pattern. If we don't test we don't get positives. Simple. The reason India started rise of cases long after countries like Italy, is simply because not many people from China come to India and vice-versa. Most cases in India are imported from western countries when they were already affected and panicked Indians started coming back. Italy just had the plain bad luck of being the first country outside China to be hit. And we entered a lockdown early, with only 500-600 cases.

Apart from that there are few speculations on why India is not affected as much as it should be. Again these are not proven:

1. Relatively higher temperatures decreases the spread of the virus.
2. BCG vaccine
3. Mutated, less potent strain of the virus This could be the reason:

"A polite request to all Indians here  Our society thrives on abuse of power. We let too many idiots and abusers propagate their views with no societal checks.


if you are polite and calm,people will say ""yeh tho chutiya hai"" and fuck about. I asked a university functionary (leading private university in Manipal, Udupi - should be obvious now)  for a laptop that was part of the tuition fees, two months after my programme started. Got a lot of flack for speaking up. We're being systematically trained to closet our thoughts. Will never happen because this atmosphere rarely changes at home. That is where this habit is learned and festered. Your default Indian cultural teaching is: Respect your elders (The no matter what is left unsaid) That really bad, if i was shouted at by my manager i should think how bad it feels and shouldn’t do it when i become manger , i dont know why people become their manager who starts shouting at other just cz they were shouted at.

I have been a team lead and a Manager, i can honesty say i have always i have treated  my teammates how i wanted be treated by my seniors and always supported them. 

And employees are not slaves , you only pay them for the work they do for you and u dont own them . 

I have seen a guy who was acting manager who was shouting at in his friends company , complaining about being shouted at by his manager  where he actually worked for salary . The hypocrisy that's indeed the case most of the times.

a lot of ""millennials"" and younger folk do indeed treat folks younger than us, folks in retail jobs & traditionally ""low profile"" jobs (like Security, Maids, Janitorial staff) with more respect than our parents did.  

there's always the odd argument & disagreement - but it's rarely based on ""class"" and ""status"".

Most of the folks who are bosses, reporting managers & senior staff do consider work life balance, mental health & many such factors as well.

hopefully the trend continues & we do indeed evolve to a better social atmosphere than one, from the years gone by. Never understood the ragging culture. No matter how small or insignificant the task is, it is not required to develop camaraderie. I've never been a part of it, and will never be a part of it. 
If I want to get the juniors to feel at home, I'll invite them to a DnD session or some pubg/csgo and chill. Why does this ragging bullshit happen in this country. Bastards who studied at the institution for extra years think they have some sort of authority over others. The notion of a ""pecking order"" is deeply ingrained in our culture:  

- The upper-caste is higher up the pecking order than the lower caste  
- Husband is higher up the pecking order than wife  
- Boy children are higher up the pecking order than girl children  
- Seniors (in office, in college, in cricket team) are higher up than juniors  
- etc.  

The person who is higher up is to be ""respected"", and the person who is lower down should expect to be yelled at and ill-treated.

I believe that this is one of the major things about our cultural mindset that makes us fail to achieve our potential. The Indians who flee the country and achieve good things abroad (Nobel laureates, global CEOs) are the ones who are able to break free of this. This is SO needed in our society.
I went to a medical school, in case you do not know the way seniors treat juniors at medical or dental Institutions is horrifying. To make matters worse, professors are aware of all the activities that happen around. You were asked to complete assignments of seniors, run errands for them, entertain them, some girls would give in and date seniors to avoid being ragged & humiliated by others ( if you date a senior, it’s basically like a shield). My friends and I would avoid cafeterias and libraries so as to not run into anybody. You have to address every senior by sir or ma’am and wish them good morning or good evening each time you see them in the hallways. There were repercussions if not followed.

Anyway, when we got to the second year we were so done with being treated like shit by our seniors. We decided to break the chain. Outta 100 from our class around 20 people were in and we did. By the time we graduated, ragging had diminished as new batches came in and it was reported to us seniors if at all anyone attempted anything. The juniors were no longer treated like slaves and people were genuinely helping each other out. There was no fear and juniors could actually hang out at the common areas.

But it wasn’t all roses, we were highly criticised and also humiliated by our own batch mates, seniors and professors for being responsible for the lack of “discipline” (intimidation) in the institution. We were told ragging and fear of seniors makes one respect them and it would give them a firm hand and authority till they graduate. I always hated being made to work late night or attend late evening calls.

So when I became a manager - no more meetings or calls after 6pm, and any work left after 6pm is deferred to next day.

My team is the worst performing team in the company apparently according to some qualitative parameters that My boss (director of firm) has in mind.

Essentially most Indian Matrimony profiles have contact numbers of parents. They do this to keep their  child away from the prospective spouses UNTIL after the basic vetting process is completed.

And also a lot of parents are exactly savvy. They don't exactly have to follow SLAs while responding to such queries on WhatsApp, SMS or even the chat function inside the Matrimony apps.

If you can, I'd recommend get you parents or someone senior to call up that number to make the initial, basic level enquiries. This is almost always how most communication between Matrimony contacts happens.

When there was no way left for constitutional methods for achieving economic and social objectives, there was a great deal of justification for unconstitutional methods. But where constitutional methods are open, there can be no justification for these unconstitutional methods. These methods are nothing but the Grammar of Anarchy and the sooner they are abandoned, the better for us.”

“There is nothing wrong in being grateful to great men who have rendered life-long services to the country. But there are limits to gratefulness, as has been well said by the Irish Patriot Daniel O’Connell, no man can be grateful at the cost of his honour, no woman can be grateful at the cost of her chastity and no nation can be grateful at the cost of its liberty.

This caution is far more necessary in the case of India than in the case of any other country. For in India, Bhakti or what may be called the path of devotion or hero-worship, plays a part in its politics unequalled in magnitude by the part it plays in the politics of any other country in the world. Bhakti in religion may be a road to the salvation of the soul. But in politics, Bhakti or hero- worship is a sure road to degradation and to eventual dictatorship.”

…They form a union of trinity in the sense that to divorce one from the other is to defeat the very purpose of democracy …

Without equality, liberty would produce the supremacy of the few over the many.

Without fraternity, liberty would produce the supremacy of the few over the many.

Without fraternity, liberty and equality could not become a natural course of things. It would require a constable to enforce them.”

On creating a national identity:


“If the people of the United States could not feel that they were a nation, how difficult it is for Indians to think that they are a nation. I remember the days when politically- minded Indians, resented the expression ‘the people of India.’ They preferred the expression the ‘Indian nation.’

I am of opinion that in believing that we are a nation, we are cherishing a great delusion. How can people divided into several thousands of castes be a nation?

The sooner we realize that we are not as yet a nation in the social and psychological sense of the world, the better for us. For then only we shall realize the necessity of becoming a nation and seriously think of ways and means of realising the goal.

The realization of this goal is going to be very difficult – far more difficult than it has been in the United States. The United States has no caste problem. In India there are castes…But we must overcome all these difficulties if we wish to become a nation in reality. For fraternity can be a fact only when there is a nation. Without fraternity, equality and liberty will be no deeper than coats of paint.”

On responsibility:

“…let us not forget that this independence has thrown on us great responsibilities. By independence, we have lost the excuse of blaming the British for anything going wrong. If hereafter’ things go wrong, we will have nobody to blame. Except ourselves… 

…If we wish to preserve the Constitution in which we have sought to enshrine the principle of Government of the people, for the people and by the people, let us resolve not to be tardy in the recognition of the evils that lie across our path and which induce people to prefer Government for the people to Government by the people, nor to be weak in our initiative to remove them.

"Which Side Should I Choose ?  To think critically, the first thing you need to do is read both pieces.

Then you have to dissect each article. Identify their claims.

Then use your knowledge of history and the context the piece is written in to scrutinise each claim. Go at it with a scalpel, so to speak. If you find yourself unfamiliar with the topics being raised and the themes being discussed, then start doing research on these topics.

For me personally both articles are largely full of hot air, and of not much significance outside of intellectual masturbation.

While Taseer has a claim in that he has held PIO/OCI status for decades in spite of his Pakistani origin, it is also a fact that clerical error by the government is not an excuse to bestow unauthorised privileges to any individual ineligible for them.

On the other hand, Singh plays the ""what about Pakistan and the UK"" card, aka *tu quoque* or the appeal to hypocrisy fallacy to discredit Taseer's claims. After all, India's actions should be reactionary to what Pakistan or the UK are doing and there are no better standards than these two countries if we do have to compare. I don't think an op-ed should lead you to form your mind on anything. If that was the case then Aatish Taseer's post is more articulate, less hateful and obviously more credible. 

Evaluate the facts, and let your own sentiments guide you. Do you agree or disagree with the people who are saying these things and if so, why ? Considering the hit piece on Aatish reads like a  juvenile retort with shit like 

> Aatish Taseer is both Indian and Pakistani and neither; neither Hindu nor Muslim, but also both; colored, immigrant in the West; an exotic dream of all the feminists; male and female; of every democracy where universities are factories for pumping out legions of Social Justice Warriors.

I don't see any reason to take it seriously. I read both pieces. The first one is a slightly emotional but very valid criticism of recent Indian policy. The second one is a hitpiece that doesn't really offer any solutions, just says a bunch of things about the author, brings up pakistani jihad and marxism and then basically says to the author ""oh the indian government treated you badly because you're muslim? too bad, get used to it, India is HINDU now and people like you are going to be trod underfoot by people like me"".

I honestly don't see how you can read both pieces and think they're equivalent.

As a word of advice, when reading stuff like this, take the Author's sentiment, and carry it to it's logical conclusion. What would a world that was run by the author, based on what he has written look like? What policies is he advocating for? What does he want to change? What will he keep the same? Would I want to live in that country? Would my friends want to live in that country? Who does the author consider enemies? Why? Who does he consider friends? Why? 

Try and hold those questions in your mind when reading anything remotely political. You'll soon start to see some pretty clear patterns and begin to understand who you agree with and who you disagree with.

Personally Harbir Singh sounds like a flog who talks a lot and uses big words he doesn't understand in an attempt to sound intelligent. He doesn't really offer any solutions at all. You can quickly see that he considers anyone left of him to be an enemy of not just himself, but the nation as a whole. He also considers india a hindu nation and has no time for muslims, minorities or anyone else who may disagree. His ""friends"" are in the government and the establishment. The country he wants to see is one that has a single religion, maybe two if you allow for sikhism.

You don't need an in depth knowledge on politics to understand whether or not you like that outcome.

But look up the political compass questionnaire and do it. You'll get an idea of where you stand. So I read both pieces. We can definitely dive deep into both articles and present various points. But I will just share 1 observation. The movement that the left is fighting for is against real victims who are actually suffering the discrimination in their societies, their workplaces.

The second article on the other hand presents the white man, hindus, zionists as systematic victims which is an entirely false narrative. Sure they will give examples of terrorists in the US and India where they are the victims, but that's the result of fringe groups. They aren't victims of the system. Hence the entire argument falls flat because of the so called ""bogeyman"" that's coming for these privileged groups.

Just my opinion I don't know about the aatish taseer guy, but the toi blog is hilarious.
>And then it all went wrong. Having won most of everything it fought for, but unable to be in any state of mind except one of self-righteous outrage against the evil of the oppressor, decided that justice wouldn’t be achieved till the Evil White Man was be destroyed, along with his history, his culture, his place of honor in the fabric of the world. Bring on the immigrants. Bring on Muslims. Bring on every colored person from everywhere in the world, however they can make it. Fill the west with them, bury the White Man’s society and the world he built, bury it under the swarm of foreign cultures who will never agree on anything among themselves except to be allowed to keep coming, and to take whatever opportunities of money and power that can be taken from the white man.  
Democracy has been turned into the ultimate weapon to destroy the societies that birth democracies. The strategy is simple, import so many people who’ll have the vote but will not subscribe to the White Man’s culture, history, or values, and will simply vote them out of existence.

Well what do you know, this guy is a white nationalist. Even fox news would be hesitant to publish this.

>Aatish Taseer, Arundhati Roy, these are all limousine Marxists. For whatever Marx got right, what he got wrong was that the working class has no identity, or should have no identity, other than an economic one: Labor. This lays the seed of a “secular” ideology that is different from the Secularism enshrined in the American Constitution.  
American secularism is the separation of Church and State. But where it protects the state from Religious Law, it also protects freedom of belief and conscience from persecution or manipulation by the state. That is true secularism. Marxist secularism however does not seek a separation between belief and state. The Marxist ideal is an ideological state, and the ideology tolerates no rivals. While the Marxist working class rights origins of the Left have disappeared, Marxism has mutated and switched from economics to culture. Now the ideology is that the Christian White men, Hindu Nationalists and Zionists are the oppressors, and their victims are righteous in uniting in revolution.

And as always, these people haven't read marx but like to think they know everything about him. As far as I know, arundhati roy is a social democrat and aatish taseer is a liberal, none of them espouse marxism. Looks like this guy has been reading those ""cultural marxism"" conspiracies out there.
>The Marxist DNA of Oppressor and Oppressed has jumped from the soul of the Soviet Union over to the West following the fall of the Berlin Wall.

[Oppressor vs oppressed is an explicitly non-marxist way of thinking](https://libcom.org/library/gaspar-miklos-tamas-telling-truth-about-class). Marx doesn't look at capitalism as a caste system where evil rich people steal from virtuous poor individuals, but rather as a system where capital kind of takes on a life of its own and where someone being a capitalist only really means that they are a 'conscious representative' of the logic of capital flow. From Capital Vol 1:

>""...looking at things as a whole, all this does not, indeed, depend on the good or ill will of the individual capitalist. Free competition brings out the inherent laws of capitalist production, in the shape of external coercive laws having power over every individual capitalist.""

so it's not like the capitalist class are an oppressing group that imposes their will on the oppressed proletariat, but instead both are subject to the logic of the system itself. Article one points to a problem. Article two is an ad-hominem on the author of article one. Which one do you think you should lean on? I've studied history from places that are considered the best for history (Indian History especially). My opinion is that, sure all of the information etc definitely needs to be verified. But all said and done, sometimes the question is not about logic really, it's about what is moral. 

Firstly, there will be convincing arguments from *""both sides""*. The test for a good history piece is the way they deal with archives and sources. If you are trained at JNU or Cambridge or one of those well established centres, they will always quote their sources. If you go to that quoted document in say National Archives in Delhi, you will find that for sure. Not the case for the speculative ones. Hearing ""both sides"" means that you take a stand about which one is good and worth hearing out and which ones are not. Not that you give them equal value after hearing them.

*Sources* are themselves very tainted. Unless if you are trained, you will at best have random things to say about sources. If you read a historian writing about a purana, or a sanskrit source, they know the context if they are trained for years in Sanskrit, and a fair idea of what things are common in those times and whether that purana exaggerates or not. And you can see that they don't take their sources at face value. It's pointless to say, ""It's written here, so it must be true"". A good historian should be able to say whether something is believable or not depending on the way things were during that time and the way these sources are handed down to us.

Next, you can check the *credibility* of accusations. If someone is saying stuff like ""liberal left naxal historians"", it is just vague at best because all those words mean very different things. In contrast, take : ""so and so person's sources do not speak of pendrives, and it completely ignores the works on history of technology, does not speak of semiconductor based computer systems, and the author has no background as an engineer or a historian"". This is a sensible thing to say because it points out why something is baseless.

Now to *""biases""*. Sure, everyone has a point of view and narrative which they write as history. But are they considering evidence properly? Are they trying to be logical? Or they just saying, ""I wish it were like this, so let me just fabricate it all as if it's all real""? You'll see that everyone has to do this to an extent, but you must ask : Are they trying to do an honest work, or just trying to fool me on hearsay? You'll always find there are some good quality ones which stand miles ahead. And some that are just trash. 

I've had friends who come from hardcore RSS families and many others who are not. And, there are books or articles that say all sorts of things. But end of the day the question is, are you willing to hear someone just because they have a lot of political backing and agree that all Muslims are murderers? Or just because you want to take the side of a persecuted minority you'd be willing to say no Muslims are murderers? Good histories are not about these kind of polarising questions, because the answers are never yes or no. These are really stupid questions. It always depends on the time, the place, the politics, etc.

A bit about *propaganda*. Try to see who is saying what and why. The RSS is founded with the Nazi inspiration and wants to create a Hindu Rashtra like European countries. And the BJP IT Cell is it's frontline bastion is famously spreading fake news qs propaganda for the same. Apply any logic, and most of what they say turns to vapour. They'll never explain their position step by step if you ask them, they'll just say it's true, and ask you to believe it or not, and blackmail you by saying you're not a true Indian or Hindu if you don't. I tried hard, but I just cannot trust them. They are full of hate, and do name callings like ""Pakistani agent"", ""pseudo intellectual"", etc, and that's all they have to explain as their arguments. 

There are other histories that are way better written. If you ask them why they are saying something, they'll have a step by step explanation for that. Some explanations are bad, some are good. But there's at least a discussion there.

In the end, you'll believe what you want to. You'll read what you want to. But, what is the kind of society you want to be in? Do you want to be a close minded person who never read ""Left naxal paid pakis"" and base your entire ideology on hating them? Do you want to rather hear opinions for their credibility and logic to pick what you'd like more? Would you rather focus on caste and class inequalities and dismiss all these as liberal nonsense? Would you rather focus on gendered discrimination and not bother to think of all these other debates as much? It's upto you.

In our times, when things are so overpoliticised, historical validation is not even a necesary question to take a stand. As in, you're lying to yourself if you say well let me hear both. Even if at some point some (Upper Caste hetero) Hindus were persecuted by some Muslims, are you okay with killing Muslims now? Or vice versa? Is it okay to send armed police men with grenades into unarmed girls hostels at night? Is it okay to revoke an OCI card of someone of Indian descent, just because he doesn't like the Government? Here, it becomes a question of conscience. The critic is crying out why Mr. Taseer is not criticizing Pakistan. The article Taseer wrote is about India. Taseer grew up in India and had Indian residency papers until recently. Why should he talk about Pakistan? Maybe he will if he writes an article about Pakistan. The critic is not addressing the points Taseer is raising but rather going on about leftists.

If your critic starts calling you some ""ist"", that is a minus point for him, because rather than address your argument, they place you in a group and then attack you with all the malice they have for that group. >	I’ve never thought much of Aatish Taseer.

At present, it is tempting to estimate the case fatality rate by dividing the number of known deaths by the number of confirmed cases. The resulting number, however, does not represent the true case fatality rate and might be off by orders of magnitude [...]

A precise estimate of the case fatality rate is therefore impossible at present.

2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV): estimating the case fatality rate – a word of caution - Battegay Manue et al., Swiss Med Wkly, February 7, 2020


The case fatality rate (CFR) represents the proportion of cases who eventually die from a disease.

Once an epidemic has ended, it is calculated with the formula: deaths / cases.

But while an epidemic is still ongoing, as it is the case with the current novel coronavirus outbreak, this formula is, at the very least, ""naïve"" and can be ""misleading if, at the time of analysis, the outcome is unknown for a non negligible proportion of patients."" [8]

(Methods for Estimating the Case Fatality Ratio for a Novel, Emerging Infectious Disease - Ghani et al, American Journal of Epidemiology).


In other words, current deaths belong to a total case figure of the past, not to the current case figure in which the outcome (recovery or death) of a proportion (the most recent cases) hasn't yet been determined.

The correct formula, therefore, would appear to be:

CFR = deaths at day.x / cases at day.x-{T}
(where T = average time period from case confirmation to death)

This would constitute a fair attempt to use values for cases and deaths belonging to the same group of patients.

One issue can be that of determining whether there is enough data to estimate T with any precision, but it is certainly not T = 0 (what is implicitly used when applying the formula current deaths / current cases to determine CFR during an ongoing outbreak).

Source : worldometers These calculations don't consider the number of people who have it, but haven't been tested, or does it?

The death count, we can be certain to a point because deaths with similar symptoms are being verified.

But what if there are a million or 10 million more infected people but aren't aware because they don't have access or means to get tested?

The base in this case could be way underestimated due to testing still yet to be made available far and wide throughout the world. And that could reduce the mortality rate in a big manner. Death in extreme cases might come quick but recovery might be slow. So your formula is wrong. Mortality is always what is the chance you will die if you get it. That's an interesting perspective. Can't say much but let's wait for someone who has knowledge of this to comment. The little that I know. 

1. The first formula for calculating the mortality is the right one. 

2. Asymptomatic: Could be or could be not. We don't know as testing isn't done that rigorously yet. 

3. It won't be surprising if we came to know that China lied about their numbers, there were articles that were circulating that China hid and lied their actual numbers but I can try to get more info as one of my colleagues is based out of China.

4. Will India be fucked if community transmission? I read a couple of articles stating it has already happened (still not sure), just that we aren't aware of it because we aren't testing enough. 

Edit: Could you please explain what do you mean by India following Chinese model? And should you consider a variable for recovered cases testing positive for coronavirus again? (It's happening in many other countries, including China)

And yes: Stay The Fu*k Inside (To All of us, our families, our friends, everyone) If they test more. More cases will come and mortality rate will increase",Coronavirus

I still don't understand why people consider this as a successful policy in this century.

Anyway, I would agree with your BITCH policy if that doesn't involve selling one's reproductive capacity and exclusive only for couples who adpot. I don't think what you wrote above is gonna bring any change whatsoever. India's overpopulation problem is mostly because the poor people don't have much knowledge about birth control, poor families also think that the more children they have, the more are the income sources, and many people also have more children because they want a boy child, so they keep trying till it's a boy. 

Poverty and illiteracy are the main reasons of this problem. Anything that the government is gonna force people to do will have more negative consequences than positive. Educating people is only gonna bring some real change imo. make it mandatory for females to go to college and get a job. that works best. see western europe. see kerala.

Before the Maharashtra elections, there was a clear verbal agreement between the SS and the BJP that power would be shared, and SS would choose its own representative to be the CM for the first 2.5 years. This was hammered out between Amit Shah and UT. However, Fadnavis was not part of this discussion. Fadnavis was known as a Narendra Modi acolyte who often bypassed Amit Shah. His slogan internally during the elections was ""Dilli mein Narendra, yahan pe Devendra"".

"[Opinion] Governance and Administration participation culture must for better Electorates.  Before I offer my opinions on your statement, I want to ask if you have read Ambedkar's  *Annihilation of Caste* and M. K. Gandhi's autobiography. 

Now, in response to your statement, I would first like to point out that First Past the Post is followed in every single constituency, where the candidate doesn't need to poll 51% of the number of voters in the entire constituency, but needs to poll more votes than any of their rivals, only from among the votes registered. So, it would need a complete overhaul of the way in which votes are counted. Secondly, the alternative to a direct voting system is the election of an electoral college. Which might be fine in a bi-party system but in a multi-party system, it is infeasible and counter-productive.

But now this will be bundled with economic loss of covid-19. Thus, point of economic mismanagement will be mooted. There are two problems: (1) Doesn’t like intellectuals who tells the reality and right suggestions, which is always difficult to digest (2) Advisors are mostly coming from a particular cult and graduated from a ‘messenger’ university. Most modern economies are consumer based economy.
It's almost impossible for a consumer based economy to recover from absolute lack of demand.
More people losing jobs,- less money to spend- lack of demand - less growth of economy -. A vicious cycle.
Hopefully they consult actual experts this time. Probably his biggest test since he became PM.

"Are people(especially men) really okay with with their partner's past history(boyfriends, sexual)? or are they just afraid of being labelled backward/prudish, or just want to fit in(with liberals/pseudo-liberals)?  You are almost 30 years old, which is probably more than 1/3 of your life. Expecting someone to be waiting more than 1/3rd of their life for their future partner is a little absurd imo. There is nothing wrong in that, its just a slim possibility. Also, there is some amount of gatekeeping hypocrisy there. In these kind of prudish thoughts, its always the female who has to remain 'pure' or 'sanskari'. And if you think of it, terms like 'honry', 'dirty' will make way to pious usages like 'love making' for describing sex once marriage is done.

Personally, my future partner's past won't affect me as long as it won't cause any problem with our future. I also think its sweet to share first intimacy with someone special to each other. Anyway, once you are in love, there is no place for past but a future to be together. Here it goes. 

1. Men who have sex are not pigs. Sex isn't dirty, it's just sex. There's no meaning to it as such, other than what someone gives to it. 

2. Sex is not correlated with honour. Looking at women as honourable just because she's never had sex is making them an object and passing judgement to their character based on what your male fantasy would want to think. 

3. Sex is fun. It's nice. It feels good. There you go. Girls get horny too, you know. It's not just you who's been jerking off thrice a day for the past 17 years. 

4. What bullshit is this partners first and last ? Are y'll objects and properties owning each other ? Sex is just sex, it's fun it's nice. You can compare it to watching movies. The only moral judgement you can pass on it is the morality you attach to sex itself. 

And this is personal (you can read up the sexist origins of monogamy) but in my life I've been privileged enough to meet some girls I've been able to love. There's no legitimacy to the idea that everyone has one person for them. People do exist polygamous relationships. Sex is just sex. There's nothing more to it, character, this, that. Nothing. 

5. Why does it mean so much to you ? Maybe you've spent your entire life fetishizing sex, but that's not what everyone does. More than, how can you hold someone else responsible for something they did before they even knew you ? Why does your morality have to be overriding ? 

Don't blame others for the image of life you've created in your own head. 



Do try to answer this, why are you fine with first base and not with Sex ? I'll tell you why, cause male thought and society teaches us unconsciously that a woman's value lies in her vagina. If it was her dignity and honour which lied in her body, even someone touching her would be an issue. Why this ?!


If there was some logic to this, you should be more offended by a long term relationship with a guy which will haunt you in the future than some random one night stand with a guy who's name the girl won't even remember. Is this still a thing? I did my college in early 2000s and we were mostly traditional bunch of girls then(aunties now). Those who remained virgins till marriage were so due to lack of opportunity, definitely not due to lack of interest or boyfriends. So yeah, even now, you can find such girls who had no opportunity, just find some girl from a small town or village who has always stayed with parents or better in a joint family. lmao what the fuck is this post I am not relationship expert but you have mentioned some generalization / stereotypes in your long query.

1. Not all men are pigs and just looking for sex. Even most is generalization.

2. Sex is not at all associated with honour.

3. Sex is subjective and depend upon the individual. For some it is casual and physical. For some it is emotional.

4. Nobody indulge in sex just for peer validation.

5.  You are not the only one who thinks like that. If you prefer your partner virgin then nothing is wrong with that. But demonize someone who is not virgin is wrong.

6. If previous relationship doesn't bother the current relationship then it shouldn't be a cause of worry. And i am personally fine with that. If you haven't had any relationships, it's perfectly fine to want someone who also hasn't.

I'll be downvoted here, but as long as you're not a hypocrite, you're allowed to have your preferences.

\>When asked if I can at least ask the girl upfront

I don't know if this will work, but you can just tell her that you don't have any past experience and would prefer someone who also doesn't. If she has any decency, she will make up some excuse to back out of the rishta even if she doesn't want to reveal anything.

Also, from what I've heard from friends, 99% of them will lie and pretend they didn't even if they did have bfs. I think being *very open minded* but a *certain extent* is a classic Indian trope. Fear of society labelling you conservative has led to the invention of such labels. It’s funny. Sounds like an oxymoron. 

Anyway, as to your question. Having a past isn’t a deal breaker. You had relationships. It doesn’t make a difference. What matters is what is the current situation. Are they still in relationship being forced by their parents? Maybe they are emotionally involved but not acting on it. Blah blah. These things matter more than sexual past. 

And honestly, look for a person you’re compatible with. 

Society seems to have trained us to believe virginity = virtue/honor. But it is not so. A girl’s honor is not in her pants. We all need to understand that. 

If you like the girl and respect her as an individual and she does the same to you, that should be the basis of a relationship. People have preferences, you have one. If you are not a hypocrite, it's fine. 

Don't ask her on the first meeting. Maybe on the 2nd or 3rd meeting when she's comfortable with you. 

Tell her about your past and how you would want someone who shares the same thoughts. She'll reject you if she's had some partners. I had similar thoughts. I was 29 then. Virgin, never had a relationship, introvert, nerd, from Govt school in a Tier 2 town, not much English skills and an average looking guy. After I got settled with a good job my parents introduced me to a girl from a metro, our both families met, i spoke with the girl, I told her all about me and asked if she had any relationships before, she said she never had any. she is well educated, working in an MNC , well bought-up, she spoke well, humble smart. We got engaged and then wedding and after a week I looked at her chats and email exchanges, extreme private stuff, sex, i was completely shocked, these were very old like 8 years or so. I didnt care much at first. but I asked her anyway about her past and she denied again. I didnt tell her I saw her emails though.  


Fastforward a couple of weeks, I further looked into all her accounts, emails, google chats, old FB chats and I learned, she had like 4-5 relationships in the past 8 years, casual sex, relationships were so casual like she was with a guy for like just 2 months. I had no ill feelings for her but atleast she could have told me about all this before things went ahead with us. I confronted her with all this and she told she was afraid that her parents might come to know about her. Things went only south from here. Because she was still regularly speaking with a couple of guys. but only ""friendly"" she claimed.  


I still trusted her but things did not end good for us. I could not go ahead with the marriage and wanted to come out of it. But she is smart. It has been few years now and yet life never returned to normal. A part of me hates me for being not so smart enough to see through things early, for not handling things better and making my life a mess. I still cannot think why men/women hide things about their relationships from their husband/Wife? I believe good or bad, it is always better to come clean before marriage. Sooner or later truth eventually will come out and it is not going to end well if you hide your past. It will destroy everyone's lives. OP more concerned if you can see the number 90 on your keyboard than being a virgin at 30. So many parentheses those 2 numbers are faded out, no? Why does it bother you? If you have a good partner they would be upfront with you about their past, but why do you find the idea of a past uncomfortable?",AskIndia

"[P] How to deal with parents who support extreme government authoritarianism?  I'm here in NZ , my mom in India has been sending me non scientific deranged advice from random whatsapp forwards...n glorifying Modi in every forward. I'm so over it . She says she will support and believe every forward above me her daughter telling her to just take care. Some people cannot be saved. And after an age the mind resists change.

There is nothing conventional that will help you. You would be surprised at the number of people in my family who’ve casually mentioned shooting them down in the past week. I’m the only person against authoritarianism in my family, everybody else seems to support it even NRI uncles who are minorities where they live. All my friends are sanghis too, two of my best friends (like top 5) have turned out to be xenophobic bigots, vocal islamophobes and RSS sympathisers. 

For the fascists, it does not matter wether or not there is a minority because if there isn’t a minority, they will create one. If there were no muslims in India, would everyone be Hindu? No. They’d be Brahmins, Dalits and women. Perhaps once people start looking beyond their privileges and start hearing beyond our fascist enabling airwaves maybe a bulb will light up at the end of the tunnel. 

Our own households are xenophobic, patriarchal and misogynistic. It can be easy to loose hope every now and then. However, it is essential that we keeping forward even if only by a little bit, everyday. Each person that switches over from zee news to ndtv is a step in the right direction. I’m not saying NDTV is perfect but it is a step in the right direction. 

While you try and tackle these issues in your own home, take care of your mental health, this is exhausting and tough so don’t beat yourself up. Keep talking with your parents but talk, don’t mock. It's not just your dad, a lot of people share the same ideology. You can't really do anything about it; just let it be.

It will take a month for effects to show.
For extreme cases, it might take 3 months to get rid of the disease. 

This disease is more dangerous to India in the long term. What's the caste of your family? If you're OBC, you can play the same game of High Caste vs Low Caste, as said in manusmriti. Not following manusmriti is going against Hinduism and Modiji. 
Ask you father to pay more respect to his high caste friends. Lots of replies here mentioning you should evade or ignore. Wrong. You should clearly let him know how you detest his views without detesting him personally. This is the first step towards liberalism. Attack the idea, not the man. At the same time, don't hold back from defending your ideas just because people you like may not agree with them What you can do in my humble opinion, is try to show examples from history or even in modern day - where people have been seduced into accepting an authoritarian strongman in the promise of a strong economy or stability (even if it means at the cost of hurting minorities). What we have observed is that these kind of authoritarians aren't able to kickstart the economy in the way they promise.

Look at Russia with Putin, Hungary with Viktor Orban, Brazil with Bolsonaro.

Yoj could also make the economic argument that persecuting minorities makes the country unfavorable to investment, to businesses and for the economy in general. Conflict and social tension decreases cohesiveness and in turn increases the probability of a tail risk.

Take for example the protests in delhi, for the large majority of hindus, they aren't probably affected themselves, but the protests have cemented a reputation of India turning into a hostile state for minorities globally.

There's no point arguing over morality with people who have already given in to the dark side, if you want to change their opinions you have to be pragmatic and argue from the focus that personally affects them. Persecution of minorities doesn't affect them directly and thus they don't care, or they might even personally condone it. But showing how such acts can negatively affect themselves can change their position to a more moderate stance from their current veering towards extremist ideology. I'm in the same situation as OP.  My dad was never religious, he had many muslim friends but, now he has started making hateful comments. I tried to reason with him but he made an argument that because he is in the country, he knows better.

I hate that the pandemic is being communalised in India and I cannot let him have his beliefs when, his beliefs are based on whatsapp news and TRP hungry, propaganda pushing media channels. 
 
Now, I listen to the anti muslim news he has ( like I'm genuinely interested to know), I then share fact checked articles on it and complain about shitty media. You don't deal with them.

But I do have a solution to calm your self and be at peace again. And that solution is the one quote I always make sure to read and remember.

“When I despair, I remember that all through history the way of truth and love have always won. There have been tyrants and murderers, and for a time, they can seem invincible, but in the end, they always fall. Think of it--always.” - M. K. Gandhi Have you lit lamp yesterday?

All its going to take is a pre recorded 5 minute speech to wipe out his opposition. No.. Indian sheeple will never have a revolution.. Don't think they will even vote different, partly out of fear and partly because they are easily manipulated by religion... So nothing will happen, don't worry. Of course, if you are end up on the 'wrong' side, prepare for some inconveniences - could be sorted by money, not standing out, having escape routes etc. If you are a conscientious lot, and feel that all this is wrong, just take a deep breath and accept it. Accept the worst case, maybe we see genocide in our time or unimaginable things. Nothing else to be done now - my anxiety is not going to affect anything except my ability to be prepared. Depressing thoughts, but this attitude helps me cope now. No revolution is coming, our people is too servile for that. If you are a genuine Indian brought up in Independent India, that should be your thoughts now, unless....unless.. you are corrupted by saffron poison. 

If you drunk saffron poison, it’s difficult to ingest good thoughts into you. Saffron Poison drinker will not go alone, but he takes the entire community he belongs to, they destroys whatever comes across their path. That’s the power of saffron poison. 

Indians should wake up and spread anecdotes for the saffron poison, and eradicate the saffron poison and its creators and its benefactors altogether. The Roman empire, the French empire, the British empire, the Turkish empire all have turned to ash. Only their figments remain on earth to cast memories in minds of the people that anything built will eventually meet the dust. Only ideas and ideologies remain while flesh fades away. Anything build on sheer power, on trickery, on oppression and on greed will crumble-ash to ash, dust to dust- and eventually this regime set upon on these gruesome qualities will fall either by people or by time..... Honestly this feels more like the 3rd Reich than the French Revolution. We've already got the SA(not SS),the so called RSS. We're waiting for the night of the long Knives. And yes there were people,german people who protested to save jews,they were also killed. You can see the similarity here. only difference is that Hitler was named best leader by forbes for uplifting Germany from poverty and conducting massive industralization reforms,not which our counterpart is famed for. I really think India will have it's French revolution sooner or later. Because it's only going to get worse and worse. 
Someone somewhere is going to snap and that'll be the start. Your understanding of french revolution seems incomplete.. there has been no large scale debt hiding to start with.

"Scientific temper vs Faith  Every human is born with a curious mind. Sadly, the curiosity is killed in the early years of a child by religious indoctrination. Children need to hear ' I don't know. Maybe we can learn together or maybe you will discover/invent it in future.' Sadly people have too much ego to say 'I don't know'. 

Until people learn the importance of skepticism, billions of children will be robbed of the opportunity of becoming adults capable of progressing our civilization.

If we don't ask the right questions we can never hope to get the right results. No matter how big the question and no matter how hard it might seem we are still supposed to ask it. 

However, what I am personally seeing around is that whenever I doubt our current system and ask uncomfortable questions about it, the immediate reply is 'So what's the solution?' and I may not have a solution. Then it immediately turns me into 'person who is always critical'. I believe this is a big problem. If we continue this way we'll never get to the answer as the questions are not being asked and we'll always be stuck with current problems. I agree with this. People don't feel the need to question basic stuff like 'Is what I just heard/read/saw actually true?' They have been imparted with this ignorance since their childhood and they keep believing it. They never get outside of the box that they grew up in. And then come those who can manipulate these people with a single line.

"Missing Dr. Manmohan Singh 😞  History is written by the victors. 

The wave of right-wing nationalism has only begun and will continue unless nipped in the bud or countered by an equal and opposite wave. The chances of either of those happening anytime soon is rather low. 

This bunch sees everything in black and white - no understanding of the concept of nuance. They have shown that by constantly shitting on the first PM of India. I don't think they will show Dr. Singh much quarter, sadly. The smallest dog barks the loudest I've lived through that. 2013 uttarakhand calamity. The centre was not at all responsive and late af in recognising the severity of the situation. apun ko sardar mangta🇮🇳😤 Manmohan Singh was a great Finance Minister. That's it.

The UPA was no better than the current government. Yes, they are not openly Islamophobic but that's pretty much the only pro they have over BJP. They were riddled with scams and the PM played second fiddle to Sonia. Unless they get their shit together and elect an able leader or AAP somehow manages to woo voters nationally, the current government has nothing to worry about for the next decade. And that's a scary thought. Both of them wouldn't do jack shit to help you in your day-to-day life. Spend time with family, take care of your loved ones and hope all of us pull through this. We simply use these comparisons as a reason to fool ourselves. Maybe people have forgotten Nirbhaya protestor being hosed down and the deluge of NPAs from loans freely handed out during UPA II and the thousand other things wrong with that administration that resulted in the NDA sweeping everywhere in 2014.

Nevermind that he was always subservient to the party and had nowhere near the authority that a Prime Minister should command.

This whitewashing of the UPA is an injustice to history. UPA II and was a colossal failure and so was Manmohan Singh as Prime Minister. How old were you when he was pm? The ungodly bifurcation on AP still haunts the state his cm ys rajashekar Reddy gave away millions in fees reimbursement which encouraged many asshats to open fake colleges and reduced the quality of engineering less than zero, and that's just in my state. Don't be so edgy buddy ,you might trip and fall of the cliff Well he was highly educated but lacked spine. Even his own party didn't give any shit about him. He was misused by Gandhi's and he knew that but still went on serving them.

Also TMC really?? The party which still continues to defecate in name of democracy, whose leader puts people in jail just bcoz a meme was made on her.

Also a very low effort post The way he is afraid of reporters is too much. N now they are reopening case of ndtv again. Claiming that UPA finance minister was great is the most bogus claims that I have heard in recent past. I want to know how we are in current economic scenario go and read about Twin Balance Sheet problem. NPA's where a ticking bomb and they have taken economy down with it. And by the regarding NPA's Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 is one great economic reforms past in last few years.

I do agree that Manmohan Singh was a great economist but he was a poor PM.

And about schemes not favouring poor go and read about Ayushman Bharat Yojna. PM humility in first speech is compared to no one accepting that our health care system is poor and we need lockdown to control the spread and seen nothing as less.

My father when he called, me told that Muslims are spreading the virus intentionally because they believe it is sent by Allah to kill evil forces, so they want to spread it everywhere according to their god's wish.. [removed] Yeah why do you think news channels are barking like dogs over this incident? They have found the perfect scapegoat to cover Modi government's incompetence and mistakes. I'm so tired of these media companies who have figured out what type of journalism gets the most TRP. We should boycott their sponsors but a lot of them are funded by politicians themselves which is really fucked up in itself. [deleted] What I see in social media is that the anger against the virus is getting channeled towards Muslims for the Delhi incident, Kejriwal for failing to prevent the Delhi incident, Kerala led by communist government for being the state with high number of initial cases imported from communist China and Islamic middle East and then spreading it all over India.. And ofcourse the usual suspects like Mamta, Rahul Gandhi, Ravish Kumar etc for criticising Modi and doing politics during such a time of war like crisis..

I know it's not alright to organise this big event at this time but I'm 100% sure that at 10-15 march whole India were sleeping on this, It's the responsibility of government that why they let this big event get organised at that time. 

But, It's like a dream for BJP to find people at Nizamuddin. They get people to put their blame on and cherry on top is that they're muslim. So they'll do whatever possible to frame it like we tried but see Muslims are bad so because of them it happens. 

It's a nice virus, If this government doesn't do some good measures other than banging utensils and lighting dia and candles then I'm afraid what our future is going to be and I'm 100% sure that people will blame it all on Tablighi jamaat like it's there intention to spread the virus in India. 

Back in 2015, I attended a conference of a Congress MP and I asked him a question regarding India's future economy and where they see India at 2025, that MP clearly said that time ,"" Economy will do fine, It's always on autopilot, we just need to check that it'll stays on its path but I'm more concerned about our social democratic fabric as far as this government ideologies stays in the country, I'm bit concerned about our secularism until 2025 "" 

I thought that time that he's just taking the hype nothing much but now as I saw it, This government never leave a chance to defame the Muslims of this country, not even a single chance, they're create chances and find ways to defame a particular community of this country. Maybe I'm sounding too much but in past 3-4 days every other guy I talked to about corona brings Tablighi jamaat as the main reason for it, No sense in their talking, they don't know what the desiese is from where it spread and came.

Thankfully the identities of none of our covid 19 cases (neither Hindu or Muslim) have been leaked.

Something much worse than the 2002 riots is ahead of us, it always was but now with the Covid-19 situation acting as a catalyst we are going to reach there sooner. A couple of points

Don’t consider this as a debate to your points, just my PoV. BJP stands for divisive politics. In a state where the minority is a majority they play the outsider insider politics. A place where the majority is the majority the play the caste wala card. BJP is being run like an efficient political business so i don't see when and how it can be stopped. If you kill in the name of religion, your God has already forsaken you.

First, flu doesn't affect the whole population in a short period of time. Its infection is spread out in a longer period of time so that it doesn't overwhelmed healthcare facilities. So those infected can get proper treatment. It's also less lethal and less contagious.

Second, anybody could fall sick or get into a situation that requires medical help but wouldn't be able to because hospitals are filled with Covid-19 patients. And this would increase deaths from other causes. Pregnant mothers too aren't able to get medical assistance as a result.

Third, we don't yet know the long term implications of Covid-19. Death isn't the only thing that we should be concern about a disease. Will any tissues or organs be impaired permanently? Do those who recovered become fully fit and healthy? I am sorry but this is just bullshit. Is it a threat to humanity? No But to accept death rate 2-3% in 21st century is not acceptable.

"Do you feel coronavirus saga will define a generation?  No I don't think so. 12 million to 18 million (\~5% of population) died in India from the Spanish flu in 1918. But nobody remembers it, there are no novels or poems or personal stories about it either in folklore or in written literature, the independence movement didn't particularly address it in any way. More people today know about jallianwala bagh deaths or WW2 deaths than either the flu deaths or the famine deaths of the 40s or even the more recent 2001 earthquake deaths or the 16K deaths and half a million displaced in 2004 tsunami. For some reason, natural disasters don't seem to dwell for long in social memory. It will... It will change the way we look at our lives and define our lives after this crisis I believe. If it comes back for a second wave after 6-8 months then definitely I think people will be a lot more cautious in transitioning back to how things were before, especially for the first few months after things die down a little.

"Mom's (F58) boss keeps harrassing her to go to work even during the lockdown.. is there any action she can take?  Ask your mother to lie a bit if she can. She can say that while she was on the way to the office, she was stopped by the cops. They wouldn’t let her go and were about to arrest her, that’s when she gave them the boss’s name and phone no asking them to verify from the boss herself. They took the details and let your mom go but they have threatened legal action against the boss. A repository of lockdown offenders is being built in the city and they will be named and shamed with an FIR and their property auctioned to fund coronavirus healthcare. 

Ask your mom to tell her boss that she may expect a call from the police anytime. Hi OP

 So ask your mom to do this next time her boss calls. Ask boss to send her the order in written paper signed and emailed on office letter head. As you mentioned she works for railways I am 100% sure she won't give your mom anything in written. And as long as the word are verbal aunty can ignore it if she feels like doing so

 And if she gives it in written because she is that stupid. Then just forward the letter with your mom's reply on file to seniors GM, district collector and her boss ka immediate boss explaining age and risk of corona. Tip the police. Unless the 'work' falls under essential services, report it to the police. I don't think higher ups will take her boss's side. Does your mom have union membership? Communicate through text and email. She should Write a diplomatic email, without pointing fingers at her boss, apologising that she can't come to work as she had the highest risk to the Corona virus, because of diabetes and old age. This should be CC'd to her boss. 

This will have two effects: 1) her boss might back off 2) in case your mom goes the office, and does get Corona virus, then you'll have written proof and you can hold her boss liable. Cough loudly while on the phone Don't take her calls. Get something in writing. If she calls, send text saying sorry I have a sore throat and bad cough cannot talk please text me.

Or just say sorry I have cough and fever need to quarantine for 2 weeks in case I have covid19, do not want to spread it to anyone. End of story. Just ignore what the boss says.

"Indian govt banning investment from China is yet another ""masterstroke"" by Modi - this time, to kill startups.  China is a snake dressed as a puppy. Best blocked. Look how the CCP is protesting now saying that India's protections violate the WTO rules. Where were the WTO rules when lakhs of crores worth of state sponsorship was given to CCP companies to dump products everywhere at prices lower than the raw material costs, simply to kill the domestic manufacturers? You cannot even get a Diwali lamp that's made in India these days, and it is because local makers cannot compete with the state subsidized manufacturing and dumping by China. 

Honestly, if a startup is really good, money will flow in from everywhere. Companies like Paytm are not real innovations. They are data mining operations. Great startups have marquee investors from US, Singapore, Korea etc. We don't need China. 


They have taken over companies all across EU and Australia. They sneak in, then buy it completely. > Paytm to Zomato, Byju’s, MakeMyTrip, Swiggy Ola, Big basket 

These companies are hardly innovative and just do the middleman business but online. Too much VC money is not good for whole business ecosystem. These companies are subsidizing to create mono/duo-poly, and crushing down the other competing domestic startups. We don't want that. 

> Why did mere 0.2% additional investment in HDFC trigger the govt so much? 

HDFC is a [systemically important bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemically_important_financial_institution). In short, a bank, insurance company, or other financial institution whose failure might trigger a financial crisis. They are colloquially referred to as ""too big to fail"". Owning every % of HDFC is like owning a part of Indian economy, So obviously Indian Govt. will loose their shit if China invest more in this company. > Indian startups are among the most innovative companies in the world, and have recorded huge growth despite negligible assistance from the Modi government.

Dude, what the hell are you smoking? Indian startups are mere copycats of Western businesses! Flipkart copied Amazon, Ola copied Uber, Oyo copied Airbnb, PayTM copied Paypal, Zomato copied Yelp, the list goes on!

> 1. Why did mere 0.2% additional investment in HDFC trigger the govt so much? Owning 1.1% of HDFC gets China no say in any matter related to HDFC.

HDFC Ltd. is a lending company with deep ties to the banking sector. Even a 1% stake lets them get into the board, and they get veto powers. A CCP-owned firm having veto powers in one of the largest banking organizations of the country? No, thanks!

> 2. What kind of thought was put into this decision? It's clear that Finance Ministry doesnt put much thought into most of its policies (as evidenced by the downward spiral of economy and key finance ministry portfolio holders more interested in goli maro than economy). But is killing startups during an already fast growing global pandemic crisis really required?

While I agree that the finance ministry is daft in regards to various policy matters since it is controlled by the PMO; a veto against China won't kill startups. What kills startups are their lack of revenue management. Almost all startups are running in losses! How long will financers back these companies? Businesses exist to generate profit; yet most modern startups don't have those plans in sight (both Indian and foreign startups as well).

> 3. What kind of relief will India provide to its startups? Indian govt coffers are already running on fumes. Just to deal with Coronavirus disaster, billions of dollars would have to be spent by the govt that will leave little room for other reliefs. Infact the only way govt can survive is by taxing already tax payers even further. In this situation, is Indian govt equipped to provide any relief to startups?

Why should government systems provide financial aid to companies, both startups as well as established businesses? That whole line of thinking is wrong in my opinion. Unfortunately, the worst precedent was set when government bailed out banks during the 2008 financial crisis. Yes, businesses have been hurt by Covid-19; and a lot of them have incurred losses as well. Isn't it part of running a busines? If startups don't learn to not put all their eggs in one basket, the government cannot help it. The most a government can do (and I am not talking BJP / Congress here) is relax taxation and bureaucratic mess of paperwork to ease startups to get back to their feet. I don't think India has banned investments. They just made it mandatory to seek government approval before its done.

If China is pissed they can take it up theirs.

You just need to look at Australia, if you want to see what giving China free rein could mean in a tough situation. What are the anti takeover laws you are talking about? Do you have an example of any country implementing it successfully? 

Not in a harsh tone, just curious. I do not understand why everyone thinks they are financial experts and the people running the country with advisors who are some of the best experts in their fields are all idiots.

As for answering your question, you have to think bigger and broader than just startups, as an effect of coronavirus there is going to be a recession and most industries would be going into red, so as to avoid hostile takeovers and keep the industries safe the decision was taken.

You should open your mentality a little broader and read about what China has done in Maldives and how much debt Maldives is in right now. You can also Google about what China is doing in Africa.

Instead of appreciating when the country actually takes steps to protect its national interests and assets here you are deriding it and favouring China. I am truly speechless.

"Since some people actually believe Mamata is worse than Modi, lets's see how she compares to the other CM candidates from the other parties of the state.  >Unfortunately 9 years is too short a time to right what happened over the past 60 years.


Same excuse the bhakths giving for Modi.


I like your interesting take on Mamata where you've conveniently ignored the following:


1. Corruption - Only Mamata bhakths believe that she and her party members had nothing to do with the Sarada scam. Or the other chit funds. The cases are still pending and the money is totally gone. Whatever money was returned to the few was taken out from the state funds. A bridge collapsed in the middle of city and tmc government didn't bat an eye. Trifala scam has started again. There's too many to list here, but do check what Abhishek Banerjee has been doing for the last few years. 


2. Intolerance - Calling students Maoists and arresting them. Arresting professors and putting them behind bars without fair trial for posting a simple meme. Police violence in JU. Torturing civil service officers to suicide. 


3. Lies and Jumla - park street rape case. The accused escaped and his gf who aided his escape was taken into the party. Mamata assassinated the character of the rape victim just to give a clean chit to the accused. Everyone forgot that it seems. In this regard, care to elaborate what's she's doing with the covid 19 testing to hide the numbers? Social media is rife with tells of how people are being turned away from hospitals, and that's not bjp propaganda. I'm receiving news from my friends who are doctors that there's state sponsored propaganda to hide the numbers. Mamata even went as far to forcefully audit the deaths to co-morbid conditions so that the covid report can be suppressed. Funny thing is, unless there's co-morbid conditions, you'll not even die from covid, that doesn't mean it's not spreading.


4. Industrial output - pray tell what Mamata has done to improve the state's industrial output? Where are the jobs? We've all been hearing the empty lies from the biswa bangla summit, how many of the those projects ever came to fruition?


5. Minority appeasement - while Modi is trying to get rid of muslims, Mamata is doing the opposite, going as far as to ignore the criminal elements in the society to pander to that votebank. The attack on doctors that sparked a protest across the country was fueled by the simple fact that Mamata didn't have the guts to arrest the criminals because they were Muslims, even when the rational Bengali Muslim community tried denouncing them over and over. She has given the statement that those who came from Bangladesh and have voted are now citizens even if they have come recently, what the fuck? Mamata doesn't get to decide who gets citizenship. We don't want Bangladeshis here, no matter if they are Hindu or Muslim. Her government had even shielded war crime convicts just to get some brownie points. Why?


There's no difference between Modi and Mamata except the fact that while the first one is trying to get rid of the Muslims, the second one was trying to alleviate them to a godlike status (one imam from a Bengali masjid gave the statement a few years ago that the Muslims will decide who gets to become the CM of WB). Other than that, the lies and jumla are just as widespread, the corruption just as deep. The only reason Mamata gets away with all this is because Bengal has became irrelevant in the national stage. No one gives a shit. Else she's just as corrupt and authoritarian as Modi. And if talking about the developments, these are all being done with a single strategy. Destroy Bengal's industrial output, evict all the educated folks, so whoever left becomes solely dependant on the state for their livelihood. Meanwhile she and her goons can continue ruling the state like the left has done for last 3 decades. That's all there is to it.


Bengali's have no hope left. It's TMC or BJP, and both are cancerous in their own ways. Only chance is for an Arvind Kejriwal to rise, but that's probably never gonna happen. Most educated and literate bengali's are leaving the state, who's gonna rise to the occasion? There should be a trade off between socialism and Capitalism.

Something in between so everyone can benefit. [deleted] Nice writeup bro. 

How’s the popularity of BJP among Bengalis ? I heard they are gaining ground in some spots and local polls . 

Do you think communists supporting the BJP will affect TMC much ? Okey let's list pros and cons of Mamata and TMC

Pros: 1) Mamata is authoritarian but still TMC regime is way more free than the previous CPM rule. It was possible to openly post against TMC in social media. Such open criticism of the government or party was impossible for most people earlier.

2) Rural infrastructure is developed a lot in comparison to previous regime. Roads are improved a lot.

3) The police and the government offices are more active.

4) Smaller crimes like eve teasing and theft are reduced in my experience.

5) The government and the party is secular and not racist  at all which is a big plus point in todays India.

6) Economy of the state is improved.

7) Government officials and police has more power than the previous regime where they were puppets of the local party office.

Cons: 1) One woman party and government. Due to her tendency to control everything her government is full with people who are good for nothing and totally useless. She doesn't like people who would argue with her.

2) Her intolerance against opposition.

3) TMC is full with goons and politicians whose sole aim is to make money by hook or crook.

4) ""Appeasement"" of big groups of people for vote. Yes, not only Muslims, she tried to appease every groups who are united enough. The all India media do not show her ""appeasement"" of Hindu Matua people who are a big votebank. She tried to appease both Mullahs and Brahmin Pandits by offering them money. She also gave money to clubs and durga pujas.

5) Various scams like Sharada, Trifala etc.

6) State government employees are angry with her due to  not giving DA and other allowances at par with the central.

7) Reduction of government employments and some questionable recruitments.

Fucking real estate assholes. To a hammer,every problem looks like it can be fixed by a nail. Fact of the matter is real estate is a bad investment in India. You may buy a house if you wish to live in it. However as an investment vehicle with pitiful rental yields of 2-3% due to over supply in most cities, it is a renter's market.

Buying land on the outskirts where the city will grow into is a much better investment compared to buying built real estate. REAL ESTATE SHOULE BE THE LAST THING one should be investing in , in the next 12-15 months.

1. Rental yields from a rented home would barely be enough to cover the EMI of a housing loan ( let alone act as a secondary source of income )

2. Houses are highly illiquid investments. With the kind of job losses predicted over the next 12-15 months , one needs or have a solid savings pool to be easily accessible. If there are no takers for your house , you will have virtually no  liquidity on hand to provide for emergency expenditures ( mom and dad falling ill, deferred jobs for your sons and daughters , layoffs for you etc ) 



3. Post corona,  the reverse migration that has happened will not see most migrants returning any time soon. Most villages are self sufficient and labor migrates for better opportunities to cities. There will be  scant opportunities  post corona recovery and labour shortages will not be accompanied by commensurate wage increase as real estate firms will not be able to afford higher project outflows for labour. 

So expect massive delays on projects that are under construction . 


A large number of real estate firms will wind up. Quite a few will be stuck in litigation . You money may be stuck and you may never even see an asset.

you also have a lot of free time since there's no activity. work on yourself and your company now. look inwards. take assessment of your processes, see where you can improve workflow, focus on efficiency. with not much happening in the world, this is an excellent time to introspect since we wouldn't get time otherwise when things are busy (without disrupting operations).

I would also use this time to contact vendors who are of the same wavelength as you. you're only as good as your team. if you're taking the extra step with your vendor to ensure your operations aren't affected, you're more likely helping him and not yourself. it isn't your job to make sure he does his so that you get what you're paying for.  use this free time to search and assess vendors who take their commitments seriously as much as you do. make some phone calls, talk to people and get a feel of their product orservices. you can also use this time to negotiate and do some ground level work. this would iron out all the problems you're facing with your current vendors once the lock down is over.

"Delhi has not been given a single paisa from the ₹17,000 crore allocated to states. Here's why  I would especially like to emphasize page 99 onwards where the methodology for calculating state share of SDRMF is given. Some people were complaining that why Kerala has been allocated so less amount compared to Maharashtra. There were several speculations and baseless theories (eg- north-south discrimination) but none of the critical comments, in my knowledge, mentioned about the finance commission recommendations, which is the actual reason. None of them bothered to critique the recommendations.

I think this post provides a good chance to the people to critique the methodology adopted by XV-FC in allocation of state share of SDRMF funds. People critical of distribution of funds to various states can read page 99 onwards. This will help them base their criticism on actual facts, rather than their imagination. You can give all the justification and 'due process' you want. We all know the *real* reason why Delhi got 0. >The short answer on why Delhi didn't see a single paisa of this money is  because the Fifteenth Finance Commission (XV-FC) has not included Delhi  in its recommendations. This is because Delhi is not a state.

Yes so Delhi must get money then directly from centres funds right? like NDRF or the PM relief fund. I'm sure we have lots of funds for unforseen circumstances which have funds but can be used for this emergency especially with Delhi becoming an epicentre after the tablighi fiasco Leave all technicalities. Can someone tell me how is Delhi supposed to operate without this fund? Basically the question is why were these alternate mechanisms not used? Great post u/ringtring. Kejriwal has been moaning about not receiving funding to combat the crisis and this is a great post explaining why Delhi was not allocated funds.

Either Kejriwal does not know the reason (mentioned in the post) or is willingly not mentioning it to create a sense of bias against AAP by the centre. Either way, he needs to get his facts right. Nice research with Finance commission recommendations.

But the recommendations of the FC is ADVISORY and hence NOT BINDING on the govt. . So nothing like constitutional obligations. 

Also PM Cares has a lot of fund now so it can be used straight away ... so I feel the ball is in Central govt. court now to get funds for Delhi and put the end to this issue and not politicise by playing around. I think Kejriwal is all in his rights to ask for funds.

"Advice for an Aussie promoting their business in India? Business/Finance  It really depends on who your target audience is. Generally, the ones who prefer online education are tech-savvy, urban people and they should be able to shell out 400 rupees a month. But they'll probably form a minority, compared to the total number of students in India. Most of Indian students are in mid-sized to small towns, where 400 rupees is a big amount and parents would think twice before spending. [To give you an anecdote about spending, Spotify gives student memberships at 60 rupees a month, and all my urban friends think it's a really good deal, while a lot of my small town friends still prefer to pirate it for free.]


But at the same time if the product is worth it, Indian parents are a sucker for anything education related. But you'll have to work hard to establish that trust.  You can have a look at BYJU's - they do a lot of teaching online and they've gotten loads of funding.

The anti-muslim, anti-dalit anti-anything that isn't savarna Hindu (that too a very very specific type) policy is dangerous and the govt will unfortunately carry it out via the front or the back door.
I have also learnt a good lesson now- no party should get absolute power. The federal structure of government was designed by our founding fathers for a very sound reason. This is beautifully written. Can't disagree with any of it. Do you believe all of this will end in a remotely democratic manner? As in bjp's removal through elections? Or is it likely all bloodbath and genocide from here on culminating in civil wars and perhaps even foreign interference. As much as I agree with the spirit of this post, I completely disagree with the substance - or rather, your interpretation of India.

This isn't about _ghar wapsi_ or about Modi or, indeed, the BJP (scum though they are). This is about the creation of India as a political entity since before 1947. You see, it's this bit:

> And we certainly disagree on the definition of a ‘nation’. Hindu Rashtra and Hindu nationalism violate the Constitution. And turning India into a theocracy like Iran is what Modi and Shah and the Sangh Parivar machinery wants to do. Can Modi say under oath that he does not want to convert India into Hindu Rashtra? Can the bhakts say so?


The Constitution is only valid so long as the people of the country choose to hold it as valid. Pieces of paper have no power or sovereignty, they derive sovereignty from the people. The people have chosen to reject the constitution, because here's the kicker - the constitution and India are, and have always been, an inherently instable construct. The ideas of a secular India has always been deeply antithetical precisely because India is _not_ a nation by any rational definition of a nation. India is a hastily cobbled-together post-colonial creation that validates itself solely by creating an enemy - first the British Empire (justifiably so) and then Pakistan (unjustifiable) and Bangladesh (horrendously cruel).

It is these chickens that are, today, coming home to roost, because India's latent Hindutva was incredible easy to exploit. It always existed, it just lacked someone to point it out. And now that people are told that their Hindutva is threatened, the only justification they have always given themselves for the existence of their nation is collapsing, and they will shred the institutions meant to keep democracy safe just to keep their Hindu project safe.

India should never happened - the country was a post-colonial error, Britain's final kick to south Asia, and pretending it could ever be a secular country was a mistake. Secular nations are built on tangible cultures and cultural beliefs with concrete identities, like European nations, or Indian states. India was always Hindutva, and Hindutva was always India - all it lacked was the spark to set fire to the hatred and xenophobia that always existed, because that hatred is what justifies India's existence.

Tear the Republic down and demand statehood for your state, which is currently subjugated by India and Indianness. Sovereignty derives from a mandate of people living in consensus, and India will never have consensus that isn't phony and manufactured. That is the only way you can guarantee a better future for those not particularly religiously inclined. The idea of a Nation is based on commonality of language&culture. We preach ""Unity in Diversity"" and at the same time we also preach others to be ""Indian First"". These 2 messages are contradictory, why do we have to forgo our cultural identities to be an ""Indian"" if being Indian is just embracing the diversity?   Therein lies the ***real*** problem, the so called National Politics is stuck in a time capsule of North Centric Post-Partition Hindu-Muslim conflict. There is no nuance or logic to this narrative, BJP considers Hindu Nation as a foregone conclusion based on Partition whereas the other side doesn't have any retort other than ""let's not be a Hindu Pakistan"".

Liberals have lost the ideological battle because they're living in their own little worlds where they imagine India to be something its not. Majority of Indians don't give a damn about Progressive liberal beliefs and are drawn towards Charismatic leaders who talk in platitudes. What is the alternative to Modi? RAGA? Secularism is a noble State policy but it cannot be the only basis for a Nation. The ONLY ideological challenge Hindutva currently faces is Nativism from states such as Tamil Nadu&Bengal. Assamese opposition to CAB is also the same phenomenon, Assamese speakers have fallen below 50% in their own state and they don't want to fall any lower than that. 

>Forget Hindu texts, they don’t even have to study the Constitution

Liberals have spent the better part of 70+ years deconstructing and pointing out all the flaws of Hinduism but have done little to no attempt at highlighting the GOOD aspects of Hinduism to create a positive liberal Hindu identity. BJP has exploited this Hindu Identity vacuum by claiming that they understand&respect the good aspects of Hinduism,  people who would've sided with Liberals now side with BJP because they ""respect"" Hinduism, however superficial it may be.

>Islamophobia

You're playing right into BJP's hands by using this term. BJP can&will use an UNO reverse card and label you as HinduPhobic.  **BottomLine:**You CANNOT defeat Hindu Identity politics by appealing to secularism&constitution ad nauseam.  You have to create a political Liberal Hindu identity in opposition to their bigoted one and market it to the masses. That is the only way i can see Hindutva going down. In summary:

1. BJP wants to change India into Hindu Rashtra
2. Muslims, Christians, Dalits and people who take the Constitution and secularism seriously will oppose that
3. Hence the BJP is hiding its intentions now; it has to change people's perceptions to normalize Hindutva even more than it is normalized currently
4. So how does it justify its fascism? By creating the conditions necessary for its justification
5. Muslims protesting in the streets will be portrayed as 'Pakistanis' or 'jihadis' who want India to become an Islamic state
6. Students will be seen as supporting Pakistan and jihadis, hence anti-nationals; they want to break India into pieces
7. Intellectuals are anti-nationals and urban Naxals, maybe even supporting China
8. Slurs such as these were merely slurs, not to be taken seriously, but now they'll become actual accusations (with perhaps legal, or extra-legal, consequences)
9. A conflict with Pakistan, or a very tangible fear of one, will help these slurs become real accusations
10. Thus BJP can justify further fascist policies like detention centres (which they deny now), and even unthinkable ones",Politics

After checking the books and doing your own analysis of revenue generated and expenses you should have a good idea what state your dads business is at. PLEASE DO THIS ANALYSIS FROM THE START OF THE BUSINESS TILL DATE. 

Second thing is to get a business plan. Tell your dad to provide a business plan, after all he is running the business. Again, if he does not have this dont Invest.

If your Dad has a Company/LLP, buy the MCA records of Profit & Loss & balance sheet to know where it stands.

I do not recommend you co-sign the loan till you view the old papers & the new papers. Slightly shady, but if you have access to your dad's phone, plus his PAN number, just generate a credit report from experian or CRIF. You will get all details of his credit transactions. If it's a sole proprietorship, is your dad liable for tax audits ? If yes then you can probably try getting his tax returns or opinion ( I knows it's hard without help of your dad) from his CA who did the tax audits for your father. 

If your father is not liable then your dad's business is a pretty small one try finding his PAN and login credentials to access the return he has filed to know the position.

If he was so concerned about kids , he would have funded underprivileged children education rather than starting a school. Just make sure he doesn't start contacting any European women while he's at it. I don't understand this! You dad wants to start a school? Or does he want to teach?

Each of them are very different adventures! * Have you tried to find out what is motivating him to start the school? 
* Show him some examples of the ""risk"" associated with running a play school. Especially the legal risk (that could be deterrent to some).
* Assume he doesn't have other fall-back options (financial) for his own care/ medical expenses, then highlight that too.
* Considering that your Father has had considerable expertise in some field in the Govt sector, why not redirect him to a start a consulting firm in his core area of expertise? There are still area where experience matters, especially in Govt sector.. Don't support him financially right now, because you'll just be enabling him. Besides when he goes broke, you'll be one who they turn to. Show him Mota Bhais photo To be honest it sounds like he won't listen to you. I would suggest:


1) try to talk to him using numbers, charts, as someone suggested

2) speak to your brothers, get them to understand the financial risk, and get them to commit to supporting your dad when he loses all his savings

3) when the above don't work, speak sternly to your dad. Tell him you'll limit the money you'll give him when he burns through his. Prepare for everyone to get pissed off at you.


Unfortunately it's your financial future at stake. Everyone is going to throw kulcha in your face. Be prepared for this to become a big stink, and for him to lose all his money and for you to have to support him for the rest of his life anyway. But at least you would have tried, and can tell him and your siblings you told them so when they ask you to give up 40% of your income looking after him. If your dad wants to open a professional school,take him to see how one functions.After govt job in UP,he may have very different expectations of how work happens.Seeing a functioning one would give him context and feel for the entire project,instead of stubbornly dithering in the dark.  
If your dad just wants prestige he thinks he deserves cause of govt job,but didnt get after retirement,and is trying to manufacture said by throwing money around,abandon ship. He has to come to terms with fact that the time to throw money around has passed. I can think of two things. Either convince your dad or reduce his liquidity.

Your mother tried to talk with him? What is her stand? Can she convince your father to put at least some money in her name in non flexible instruments like NSC, PPF or tax free bonds, gold, small peice of land?

Would it be helpful to visit to a financial counselor who can point out how little 15- 25 lakh is to spend retired life?

Would it be a good idea to convince him to be associated with an educational institute for a couple of years and learn tricks of the trade?

Would he be willing to be associated with a NGO that works in field of education?

Can you try to talk to engage him with other people who tried education business but failed?

If everything fails, I think you should make it very clear that you will not support him financially. Whether you do so or not is a choice that you can make in future. 

Tread carefully on this last one. It will surely break his heart. You also risk to loose inheritance. I am just hoping that this will give him a shock and may be he will consider what he is doing.

So far, I'd only read handwavy statements like ""GST is a ""game-changer"""" from ivory tower economists, but voices on the ground like yours are the ones that show reality. 

This line in particular surprised me:

>Tata Motors & Pepperfry will have to have a registered office in all twenty states along with a GST number for each state.

It's fcked up that govt expects a service provider to have registered office in every state of the client. I know it's too long. I wanted to do justice to the issue. I got tired of writing it lol but I've tried to put down as many details as possible to explain it the anyone who reads it. I know the formatting is fucked. I'll fix that later too. This is very good, even with the occasional oversimplification. You explained everything clearly.

Having to maintain GST registrations in multiple states (especially for service companies, where the service is usually delivered over the internet, without any goods moving from one state to another) is a huge pain.

One nation one tax my ass! Yeah, to add to all this:

1. If you raise an invoice, you have to pay GST the next month without fail whether you can collect the payment or not.
2. If you're an SME, you have to constantly track whether the seller is filing his sales so that you get input tax on purchases
3. Make stupid e-way bills every time you send material out of the state and make sure they are the same as invoice

Bureaucrats make these rules on paper and flowcharts without having the experience to earn a single rupee in their life and make us go through with all this bullshit. Someone is doing more work than our Finance Minister. My CA was telling me that the government has some new regulation in the works that you have to use the sarkari GST software to upload invoices on a daily basis. He said it hasn't been put into effect yet. But if he is right, that sounds like a disaster for traders Very informative post, this is the kind of posts that make reddit india worth browsing 👍 Thanks for listing this out. IMO GST is the single biggest reason behind the current economic slowdown. And what you have listed is one of the biggest reasons. Somehow the taxation and MCA rquirements have increased manifold under the Modi regime but they are not being called out in the newspapers anywhere. The left is busy labelling Modi whatnot but they arent willing to go into the details of what is actually wrong.

The problem is that the congress/left started out by calling Modi suit-boot ki sarkar. Now they cant even turn on their blame because in reality Modi government is all about more effective taxation as much as possible. ALL of the Modi govt initiatives - Demo, increased MCA compliance, GST, angel tax results in more and more taxation - what they dont get is that in the process of making taxation more effective they have dramatically increased compliance costs for most businessmen and this is negatively impact the economy. 

Modi govt is actually more leftists than the left would like to admit. And because Modi is doing these leftish shenanigans, the left is reduced to calling him names rather than criticise him on policy and specifics. I don't understand GST that well, but I used to run a company in the past (pre and post GST era). It's still running, but I've moved on. 

Whenever we had an out-of-state client, we used to raise an invoice with IGST, as opposed to CGST/SGST split for in-state clients. 

Wouldn't that simplify the invoicing?

Like, the head branch of Tata Motors in Mumbai raising a single invoice with IGST to the head branch of Pepperfry in Delhi? 

As mentioned earlier, I might have got this totally wrong, as I don't completely understand how GST works with large organizations operating in multiple states working with several vendors spread all over the country. Looks like an excellent saturday read.

"ELI5 : the crisis at Dewan Housing Finance ?  There are multiple factors involved.

Firstly NBFCs model is flawed. They borrow short term say 6 months to a year and lend Long term say 3-5 years.
Because of this they have to constantly keep raising funds.

Dhfl crisis happened because of poor liquidity on Dhfl part as they have some 20% exposure in bad performing real estate firms. But the Main cause of crisis is because of IL&FS. They had mismanagement of funds by senior managers of their subsidiaries because of which they defaulted on emis and the crisis began.

Now Dhfl wanted to raise funds because their short term borrowings were maturing but mutual funds as well as share market was pulling money from nbfcs as they deemed it too risky because of IL&FS. Because of this Dhfl was forced to borrow funds at very high interest.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/jet-airways-timeline-when-and-what-happened-so-far-3846461.html Totally sad about jet airways leaving the scene. It was great service. It was also that one flight where tall people didn't need to pay more good leg room. The good days are gone. Miserly attitudes of India’s much famed middle class unwilling to pay for services, management issues, banks cracking down on companies run by truant owners, slowdown in the Indian economy etc. My few experiences on Jet have always been good. I hope they get operational with a new management soon. It employs a lot of people. Also the demand for air travel in India is only going to increase so Jet will leave a huge void in this sector. Yeah, it was a cheap flight and didn't feel as budget as Indigo or SpiceJet. Good service and great air hostesesseseses too. Will be missed. Yeah I've had a great time on Jet Airways as well.

I've only travelled by Jet , Indigo as of now.  
Had a much better time at Jet. On Jet, I was served free (and actually quite good) food. I got nothing on indigo. The airhostesses (guy and girl) seemed much much better on jet.  

At the airport itself, had a much better time with jet, than with Indigo. Not sure about others, or if I was in a special situation or anything, but yeah, I had a much better time on Jet than with Indigo.

(Travel experience : 1 round trip with jet, and another round trip with Indigo) Had a few memorable flights with jet.

Flew with jet when jet and air India was only premium offering...

Hated traveling by spice or go or indigo...

live life forward, not backwards. You took the right longterm decision. The blaming, bitterness and sadness for a few months is common. Convince and coax your mind that you took a good positive long-term decision for the reasons you have yourself mentioned. 

*Express* your thoughts and justifications and plans in some way. For me, writing them in detail in a diary worked. But if you're not into writing, record an audio or video of yourself discussing it with yourself. 

Or if you have a close friend who's a good listener, express it in front of them. I don't know the psychology behind why expressing your thoughts to yourself or others actually helps, but it does.

As for fear of society, most people don't bother and those who trash talk you can be ignored or even belittled. Solo life is not bad as you yourself already seem to have explored it quite a bit. I'd suggest getting into any new relationship only for positive reasons - such as love and companionship - and never for negative or shallow reasons - such as fear / reputation / social status.  take it from a 24 y/o guy, who got cheated multiple times and lost faith in love.

Entry level job in Infosys pays ~25k per month. But during their training period there is virtually no expenditure. 
 If you are going to learn programming for job security (and considering robots a threat, no less), without having any knowledge about it, I'd say try something else you already know. Programming can be fun but your motivations are not in line with what makes it fun. Absolutely, try it. But don't expect to earn decently in a matter of a couple of years.

Similarly, ""an online business"" is too vague. If you have some particular thing in mind, we can probably give you a fair idea if we'll buy it or not. 

If I were in your position, I'd try programming for a couple of months and look at what I can possibly sell online and if I can find business partners. I'll tell my experiences here and *then* ask how I should proceed.
 You can land yourself a high paying programming job provided you have good credentials like hackerearth rank / GSoC rank / github profile. I have seen a unemployed non-IT BSc Chemistry 27 year old guy do it by self learning coding. Good luck !! Working in jewellery factory means what? Are you a Craftsman? Learn to communicate clearly what you have experience doing otherwise people without understanding your background might give misleading advice?

If you do have some years of training and skill with your hands in making jewellery then it's not a bright idea to switch to programming. Unless you don't like your job, keep improving your skill. A skilled person plus a machine will always beat a skilled person alone or a machine alone. 

The problem with robots (like your cell phone), every two years maintaining them and updating software and changing their hardware designs (because what customers want change constantly and hardware improves constantly) is very very expensive. So having skilled people operating machines is always going to be the better choice.

Jewellery sector in India is quite big and growing esp exports. The amounts people are spending on top quality jewellery has hugely increased. 
One option maybe is to try to move to better companies/bigger brand names/export oriented companies etc and gain experience.  Typical Indian mentality : get on the IT wagon == one true and absolute certain way of survival.

Jaitley is out there behaving like an ignorant child saying the RBI has 3 lakh crores of ""surplus"" when in actuality, it's ""reserves"". No one knows when the economy will go haywire.

The world's best economists didn't see the 2008 disaster coming. So these reserves are just that. Reserves!

And since Urjit didn't bend, the government kicked him out. You think this was a resignation? No, it was a firing that was timed to perfection.

The replacement was announced on election result day so it gets burried in the election news.

Mr. Das with his master's in history will offer nothing but support to the government's ideas.

"So you made yourself a little bit of money, huh? How nice.  Is this a copy-pasta or did you actually spend time making up this...whatever this is Here's the TL;DR for people who just want the important stuff, without the bells and whistles that I have to attach just to keep your short attention span:

* If you're thinking about investing, take a moment to realize that, strictly in the financial sense, you're doing better than most people in the country.
* Be aware of the people who will try to stick you with expensive and bad investments. Not everyone is out to look for your best interests.
* Make sure you're bringing in more money than you're spending. Without any money left over at the end of the month, you've got bigger fish to fry. Mmhhmm, tasty fish.
* Make sure you've got all your loans and debts under control. After your monthly EMIs, think about setting a little more money aside to prepay. Loans with higher interest rates, like credit card loans, take priority. Borrowing money isn't bad, but not having a plan to repay definitely is.
* Pick up a book every once in a while. Start reading any book that picks your curiosity and gradually move towards more topical books on personal finance. It's good for your health.
* Don't invest in gold, or any other commodity. You've got better options than that. As an investment, gold does nothing but sit there and look at you. The exit plan is just hoping that someone will pay higher than what you paid.
* Don't mix insurance and investing. They are two different services, why would you want to mix them? By separating the two, you're making your financial life simpler and easier. 
* Only buy a house if you're going to live in the said house. Property as an investment is not liquid, aces high transaction costs, requires government approvals, faces high maintenance costs and exists without any transparency.
* Identifying bad investments is a greater skill than identifying good investments. Gold and real estate are bad investments. Stocks and bonds are good investments. Mutual funds that invest in stocks and bonds allow you to benefit from them.
* Have patience. All investing is for the long term. The stock market will move up and it will move down. Some days, it won't move at all. None of this should matter to you, because all you care about is the fact that over periods longer than 10 years, the stock market has always created a great amount of wealth.
* Don't watch any televised business news channel. They give you the news of the day. You're not worried about the day. You care about the year and the decade. For news, read newspapers like Livemint and Reuters India.
* Here's a basic plan: when you get paid, make sure you pay all required EMIs on your outstanding loans. With what is left, estimate your expenses for the month. This estimate will get better with time. Take out the money etstimated, and invest the rest. Begin with having three months of expenses in a liquid fund as an emergency fund. After than, pick 3-8 mutual funds depending on your risk appetite and time horizon. Refer table above for more information. Set up SIPs so that you can force some financial discipline on yourself. Review the plan annually.
* This basic plan will require tweaking based on the context of your life. But having that plan is important.
* Investing is not rocket science. Assuming you're individual of average intelligence and awareness, even you can do it with quite satisfactory results. Beware of people who will try to convince you that investing is like open heart surgery.

"Is it worth moving to Canada on the basis of job opportunity at the age of 50 as an Indian Male???  > 01.At the age of 50 is it worth ACCEPTING offer??? 

depends on what kind of life you are aiming for. there are trade-offs involved when you immigrate, so you need to look at the big picture. it's not just a financial decision, but one that involves your family, future generations, cultural changes, weather/climate changes, etc.

Please go through the NB PNP website in great detail. Read through the entire website and the application guide, etc. Do not just trust what the consultant is telling you. The canadian immigration process is quite transparent- the process is well outlined so everything you need to know will be on their website, including forms, documents required, fees, etc. Also, from the website, it seems that NB is not accepting applications for PNP currently.

&#x200B; Kem chho Pandya kaka... I will try to answer your concerns. My background: I was 15 when my father immigrated to Canada from Vadodara.

Here are my responses:

> Dollar 60,000 is suitable amount or I should negotiate? If alone or with family?? Dependent are wife + 15-year old son.

$60,000 should give you savings (even with wife + son), but you should negotiate. Your fixed costs each month would be: rent, groceries (food), travel/commute, phone etc. For rental rates, check kijiji.ca. Groceries can be $400-500. Travel I'd say up to $200. Phone could be easily $200-$250 for 3 people. 

> Currently I will be offered a work permit. I will be able to file P.R. after 6 months i.e. for me, my wife and my 15 years old son. The compulsory stay required in N.B. is 1000 days for getting Permanent Residence. Are these the information appropriate???

Work permit and then PR sounds about right. Not sure about accuracy of the information. Try canadavisa.com forums and ask there, it is a very active community.

> What may be the expenses to be borne by us i.e. visa fees, any other fees etc.??

If you are being offered a job, the company should be taking care of any visa fees. They should even reimburse you if only the applicant is allowed to pay the visa fees by CIC. Clarify this with the company before accepting the offerf.

> It is very difficult to adjust with cold weather of st john. Due to health issue related to weather, if we are not able to stay there after 2-3 months than how bond will be executed???

I don't think companies have bonds in Canada. You can usually leave work in 2-4 weeks notice (as per terms of employment). And companies can do the same, they can let you go with the same notice. I'd recommend starting in summer so it is easier for you to adopt to the weather

> Is the No objection certificate from wife is required as a part of process if proceeding alone for few months??? Or they demand it as extra security??

Absolutely not. No NOC required from your job's wife for you to go.

> My son is studying in 10th Standard. Is it advisable to complete study up to 12th in India or he should study there?

 Best bit for you is your son is in a perfect age to hit a jackpot. As I said, I was 16 when we immigrated. Best thing is that Indian high school system is rigorous while in Canada, high school is a breeze (comparatively), while universities are a significant jump in difficulty. At your son's age, he will get a significant advantage as he would already know much of the content in Maths and Science that is taught here in Grade 11 and 12. But he has to grab the opportunity as well. If I were in India, the best I would have thought of was LD college of engineering, or MS University of Baroda, yet I was able to do Engineering from University of Toronto, which is better than any IIT. Keep in mind that he has to grab the opportunity. I had plenty of Indian friends, but almost none of them took the opportunity. I had done 11th standard in India, and had to do 11th and 12th again here. If your son studied in Gujarati medium, he might have to work hard initially. I was in English medium. If he studies all the way until 12th in India, a downside is that now Canadian universities don't know how he measures up against local applicants, and now he might be competing against International applicants. So, better if he is part of Canadian high school system before 12th. (He will likely have to give IELTS (academic module)/TOEFL regardless, btw).

> Is Indian food available in St-John N.B.???

Every small town in Canada has it. But no guarantees that you'll like the taste. Often, Indian restaurants in remote towns cater to taste buds of white people than Indians. A tradeoff of not living in Toronto, I guess.

> Are there any other provisions to get the P. R. earlier??

Try express entry. Check [CRS tool](http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/immigrate/skilled/crs-tool.asp) and see how much you score. As of Oct 2018, people with score of 442 were granted PR.

> 12 My elder son is of 22 years. How can I sponsor him other than student Visa?

Please don't go for student visa. You have the right thinking. People come here with admission in any random college. In Canada, college = diploma, university = degree. If he has done bachelors, and working, best bet is for him to get 2-3 years of experience and apply through express entry (try CRS tool for him as well). I know someone who immigrated recently at age of 25 and is doing pretty good. PR from day 1 and none of the struggles that people who come on student visa go through.

I don't think you can sponsor him. He has to apply by himself as he is already 21. He may get additional points if you are a PR/citizen, but not sure. You'll have to confirm with the CRS link above.

> My ultimate goal is to settle in Canada with family in pleasant weather province. Please suggest place or another possible sources.

Pleasant weather? Vancouver. But it also rains a lot in Vancouver in summer. Still better than having snow in other parts of Canada though. Vancouver is crazy expensive to live in though, because of chinese black money in real estate. Second, I'd put Toronto. Less snow than other parts of Canada, and even cities like Ottawa, Montreal. Toronto is expensive as well, but Toronto suburbs should work out well.


Concluding thoughts:
- It is a big change to move at age of 50. As you said, you are resetting your social, family life, and business. At this point, you are moving for the sake of your son than yourself. *If it was just you and kaki, I wouldn't recommend immigrating.*
- Please consider the fact that you are also subjecting your wife to a completely new environment, with no relatives around. There are a few Gujaratis in NB now (Moncton, Fredericton etc) but most are international students, so not sure how you'd relate.
- Call me emotional, but it still haunts me that my future generations won't be able to communicate with me in Gujarati if I remain in Canada the rest of my life. Not that they won't know how to, but they won't be comfortable. In 2-3 generations, the language will be wiped out from your family. Also, same thing about good values that might be unique to India. I am still not at peace with this, and am planning on returning back in a couple of years.

PM me if you'd like to discuss more. We can chat over WhatsApp if you'd like. You make the decision, but I can make you aware of all the realities based on the experience I'v gathered here in more than a decade, and that might help you make the decision. Your salary is quite low man, even for N.B. Since you are going with a teenage son, who will enter college, your wife will have to work otherwise you won't be happy at all. Incredibly paltry salary, and there are very few opportunities available in St. Johns for getting higher salary than this. That place has very high unemployment rate. Sort this aspect out, rest everything will fall in place.  I'd advice you to post this in r/canada and r/abcd as well. You might get better answers there. Having traveled to both countries.  100000 times yes 50 is 25 in Canada. You are quite the young man, sir. Good luck. r/iwantout What are you waiting for? As long as you have done homework on validating the PR in 6 months claim, what do you have to lose?  Stay there for 5 to 7 years, become a citizen, get your son a decent shot at life in Canada and if you don’t like it go back. You have worked till 50 and obviously Ahmedabad has not given you what you are looking for otherwise, you would not be thinking about leaving at this stage of life. 

As someone who left India at the age of 17, trust me when I say you will be giving your son the biggest gift any parent can give a child- a gift of choice.

No you do not. Unless you are running a factory consuming alot of electricity. Get your shop later once you make a profit.

Up to you, if you feel your parents deserve the revenue for allowing you to conduct business from their home. (personal relations)

NO, this is your business. so it will not affect his job

What is the per piece sale price, and what is the size of the product? 

Who are your customers? How do you plan to sell the product and in what quantity.

The answers to these may change the answers to your questions. Can't you rent a shop for few months for your trial phase? 

Since your dad is a government employee, is the housing accommodation provided by his employee? If he is a government employee, then someone out there can create a fuss if they want to. That's the nature of it, and legality or the illegality of it comes later.

But again, you are at the moment not making any money. So it's okay to launch from your house. But as soon as you start making money, talk to a lawyer to see if your business needs special permits that can make your operations illegal. For instance, since the house is in your dad's name, he could be accused of moonlighting on a commercial venture. 

If you cannot find a leased space, you could also talk to your university or universities in the vicinity. Many of them have entrepreneurship cells and they could help you out with something (leasing out space, etc.)

"Law graduates of r/India, My close friend (cancer survivor), plans to do LLB this year. He is 36 years old. Is there any merit to his decision ?  I know multiple people with MBAs and PhDs who did an LLB in their 30s and 40s to start consultancies in various business related fields. None of them are practising lawyers but doing the course opened a lot of doors in terms of career opportunities. It adds a lot to your profile, depending on what field you're trying to enter. Benefits greatly in finance, investing and startup entrepreneurship consulting.

IMO it's a great move. Luckily for your friend, this is the first year that CLAT has no age limit after the supreme court made a verdict that said so. He might have to get used to all other students being half his age! lol On a slightly different note. Such a question would've been unthinkable in a developed country. This is one area I'm genuinely envious of. There should be no prejudice about age when it comes to learning. 

I hope he does go ahead and studies. We don't have enough people actually willing to study.  > IIT-Kharapur's LLB entrance exam

IITs have Law programs too, now ? I did llb around 10 yrs back, not practicing. I had a classmate 60+, only reason he did was because he wanted to ""learn more"". Very nice person, he once fought with traffic police as his car was towed from legal parking area. Traffic constable brought back his car, and said sorry to him. 

Llb 3 years course is for those holding graduation. 5 years for 12 pass. Attending classes is compulsory if you are in good college and no one cares in many others, I had 4% in my second year. So attending evening or full time should consider the college he gets admitted too.

While studying and reading the cases is very interesting, practicing would mean spending many years with zero to very low income. Many of my friend still makes less than 10k a month. This is where top law school matters. If you are graduate of such place then getting into good law firms get easy.

I believe everyone should do Llb. No matter what you do it helps to know the law. DU law admits people only upto 30 years of age

Not sure about the IIT it doesnt have a great rep though, a law school needs years of establishment to have good faculties. Most of what Ive heard about IIT law course was the teaching is terrible  If he has ample financial reserves in the form of alternative income/rent/ancestral property, it can be a very good option. Only the very few in India can truly dedicate themselves to litigation without running after money. On the other hand if you think of making money from Law after entering it at age 36, you are likely to be disappointed.

Easy and quick money in Law is only in Transactional Law (i.e. drafting up agreements/affidavits/documents and registering them etc.) and in consultancy/advisory (eg: being on a businessman's negotiating team while he/they negotiate an agreement/merger/tie-up with a potential partner).. Transactional practice can be independent/self-employed as well, infact most low-level low-skilled independent lawyers make money through drafting agreements of leave and license, rather than appearing before a Court. You can make 30-35 K per month from drafting rent agreements and affidavits, you can barely hope to make 15 K per month from fighting cases in court. Even the better known Law Firms in Mumbai do not offer their freshers 30-35 K p.m. as starting salary.

An area in Litigation is indeed profitable but it is cornered by the niche profession of **Solicitor Firms.**   Few solicitor firms will agree to recruit someone at 36 years of age. 

The best thing is someone who owns huge profitable land/rent independently practising Law in the Courts, i.e. actually pleading before a Court. Thats how the profession used to be in Pre-Independence India. Why should there be any age limit to study. Ageism is part of casteism. I guess, there is no age limit for learning.

I’m sure your friend has a graduation degree, so I will not suggest going for CLAT, since it is particularly for a 5 year course which is integrated course pursued by students after their 12th. The variants of these courses depending upon the NLU are BA. LL.B(hon), B.Sc. LLB, BBA LLB. etc.
5 years for a course is too much, when he can successfully pursue a 3years LL.B. degree. I will suggest checking out BVP Pune, BHU, etc.
It’s a much better utilisations of his time and resources too, given that a five-year course is very intensive with compulsory attendance and 2 lacs in fees in a year (approx.) if you consider the NLUs and other top colleges.

I would recommend a 3year course from a reputed state university over 5 year course through CLAT.

You know, i think there is a lot to be desired in Indian education system too. But, if you think you are going to excel in Germany simply because of the culture there you *could* be wrong. There is often a disconnect between the skill we have and the one we want. A skilled programmer who wants to be a manager, or a skilled statistician who wants to be a teacher. I am not saying skill's can't be learnt, but its an uphill task, and the results may not always be as rewarding as you want them to be(especially in terms of money since you seem to be fixated on that).

TL;DR if you go for an MBA with half a mind and full skill you will fail, you will also not become as successful in Bio-Research as you think if you go with full mind and half skill. So, take some time, chose one and then convince your mind. Either way its going to take commitment. Convincing your parents is going to be an uphill task.

"Some Gyan for aspiring MBA students about which no one will bother to talk  Just want to add to the discussion here. I'm a 2018 pass out from one of the new IIM's (set up in 2011) and the picture is not too rosy. If you have expectations of a 12lpa+ package after graduating from an IIM, there are only a few (about 30% of the batch) who have got that.  Placements are very shady and often students are forced to apply to companies which are not even heard of. Our placement process started in Nov, and there are still double digit students left to be placed with our convocation soon.

On the plus side, there is a lot to learn from studying in top 20 B-schools as the alumni interaction and pedagogy is good. All I'm emphasizing on is that the immediate reward of an extremely good job in terms of ROI and role is non-existent in the newer IIM's. What are the top 25 institutions? Seeing the state of top mba colleges ,I'd say top 20 are best. Other than that ,it's useless doing an MBA 

Many of my friends did engineering then immediately mba and now earning 6-7-8 lakhs per annum after spending 6 lakhs for two years ,doesn't make any fucking sense RoI, and brand name play a major role when it comes to do an MBA. I agree with OP to the point that this case of high competition, rat race and missed opportunities exists even among top 10 colleges of the country. Thus, if you are planning to do an MBA, go ahead only if it suits your profile or your expected career progression, and not just because everyone is doing it.  Thanks for posting this - people need to know the kind of fraud MBA education is in many colleges. 

My friend was the secretary of the owner of some private institutions who owned some B and C grade schools and colleges. They decided to start an MBA college and built one fancy looking building within another campus of their college. They were not affiliated with anyone and offered a post-graduate diploma in something-something-MBA. (Note that they are not affiliated to anyone and this diploma is just a worthless piece of paper).

They were having a tough time attracting candidates and one day the CEO asked my friend, her secretary to go and find out what the issue was. He went there during the admission seasons and also joined in with the supporting staff. He managed to convince 12 students to join the institute. The CEO immediately made him the Admission officer for the institute. The next year, the second batch under him got 32 admissions.

The fees in the first year was 8 lakhs and the second year had been hiked to 10 lakhs! 

(After the 2nd year, my friend requested a ""transfer"" to an engineering college so that he wouldn't feel guilty about how he was literally cheating people to do an ""MBA"" that had no value at all.) Where did you do your MBA from, OP? Is Christ University Bangalore any good ? How would you rate the Indian School of Business?

"[RANT] SBI worker blames me for faulty transactions even though plenty of their customers are getting scammed  SBI employee here.. I am a 25 yr oldie working in a metro branch in Kolkata. And I totally feel you buddy. All my colleagues are patronising old fucks with no technical knowledge. The clerk's working cash counter are all right i guess.. But the clerk's in back office and other desks are retarded fucks. Everyday I see people struggling to get petty issues sorted out, made to go upstairs, downstairs n no of times. Iam in credit, so can't help many of them. But whoever ends up in my cabin I make it a point of sorting out their issue, but sometimes i feel so bad seeing people struggling to get their finances in order,specially oldies. My probation batchmates are also empathic about the situation in their branches as well. Things will change when the current generation in lower management ends up in senior management cadre and the oldies in award staff cadre are slowly replaced by young tech savvy and compassionate award staffs.  Will take a decade for sure!! I don't understand - how can someone transfer money from your account without your password & 2nd factor of authentication? Or you having given a singed Direct Debit authorisation? Another time my brother had an education loan. We were paying regularly but it didn't seem to end. So we took whole account statement and tallied it with what it supposed to be. There was a huge gap. About 1.2 lacs were charged in excess. When we enquired about it, the usual computer bullshit ""computer is not wrong, it calculates automatically, etc"" 

We said nothing doing, refund the excess charges. When pressured them, they refunded 27k and said this is most they can do and I should be thankful to them for this much.

When I tried to complain to the senior officer his reply was ""hum toh nahi karenge jo karna hai kar lo""

We went to rbi ombudsman and logged a complaint there including against this officer. 

Also rbi ombudsman seemed to be inclined towards SBI so we complained against ombudsman in RBI. 

After 6 months we got 1.36 lacs back. SBI is a shit bank. 

FFS..was made to come to the branch all 5 days in a week just to update my passbook.  It's your fault in the first place that you went to SBI expecting customer service. PSU banks have this patronizing attitude that they are so generous to let you keep your money with them.

If you want a resolution of this, file an official complaint with SBI. Go higher up the escalation chain. Write to chairman of SBI, if you have to.

But more importantly, close your SBI account, and move to some good private sector bank. Once I was as naive as you with SBI. I had a current account and i had to make an urgent neft so i reached bank by 11. They made me wait till 12.30 and suddenly a douche employee comes and demands to get his work done first as his work is more important. I had promised to the person that neft will get cleared by 11 and SBI people had no regards for the client. I asked him about my work to which he says ""your work is not important""

This made me loose my temper. I immediately started shouting on that asshole employee and the branch manager. 

The building in which that branch is rented belongs to a friend. I called him too, he threatened the branch manager of ending the rent lease. 

Also gave a written complaint to regional office, local head office and RBI ombudsman. I made sure action was taken against him.

To this day that asshole SBI employee haven't found his voice back. Change authentication settings on your mobile device to Require Authentication 'For all purchases through Google Play on this device'.

One of my employees came to me in tears. Her salary cheque had not been credited in her SBI account even after a week.

I went with her to the branch. The officer looked up the account and told me that they had mistakenly credited her account twice with the amount, and then reversed the credit twice (instead of once). The officer told me that she will have her money by the end of the day.

I said, ""Nothing doing. We are not leaving until you fix this right now. You have kept this woman's money from her for over a week. You fix it right now."" He was a little taken aback and did so. Took him about half a minute.

My opinion is that if you bank with a PSU bank, you get what you deserve! Go through this OP

https://www.sbi.co.in/portal/web/customer-care/sms-unhappy >And then the icing on the cake was that he went on ""You youngsters are on the phone the whole day doing WhatsApp yet you didn't check the transaction message. I know you people are always looking at your phone and message toh aaya hi hoga. Tumhi ne nahi dekha."" All this after I explained that I know it was my fault that I didn't realise.

"[NP] Where would you recommend travelling in India as a solo woman?  I have been traveling for the last 6 months myself, and have seldom come across a female traveler that had problems. You would need to be careful though. People are friendly, but you would find creeps as well just like you would find anywhere else.

I think the most important thing for a female traveler is to choose hotels wisely. I would suggest booking zostels(a chain of backpacker hostels) wherever possible. Other than that you can book via booking.com (Reviews are really well written and thus I have rarely been surprised). Once you are in a decent hotel, the host can be of great help as he would be able to guide you with do’s and dont’s of that place. (India is a vast country, with varied culture, locals are the best people to ask for advise)

Apart from that you should maybe divide India into 4 zones and proceed one by one. In my opinion all of them have a different flavour:

* North (Himalayas) would be awesome for trekking

* west and center (Rajasthan and nearby) would be awesome if  you are inclined towards architecture

* south (Kerala and nearby) would be awesome for vipasana, yoga, beaches and forest covers

* east (Assam and nearby) would be awesome if you want to see tribal culture since it’s the most untouched part of India.

I am traveling in the north east for the next two months. Feel free to PM if you plan to be there as well. Maybe we can meetup.

You can also PM me if you want to know more about any place. I am running a traveler community startup and thus would be able to connect you with some user who is a resident of where you want to go.

Our country has many natural scenic highlights, but for your personal safety, I'd recommend staying away from the northern parts of the country, which aren't all that women friendly. 

The western and southern parts are much safer, especially Mumbai, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Chennai, and Kerala (especially for Ayurveda).

The safest place for women in India are our north eastern states.

If you're from the west, places like Goa, and most of the north east (with their strong christian roots) will be more culturally familiar.

Happy travels and do let us know if you'd like more specific advice on where to travel. I would suggest starting from places which are the safest for a solo woman traveler. I think you may prefer starting from southern states like Kerala where there are no real rural regions, so you are always near a town, and you will always find people who atleast know basic English. The backwaters and calm hills are a good attraction here. There are lot Ayurvedic centers as well, but I suggest to be cautious of anything which is over-promising stuff. There are many scammers running these things in the name of Ayurveda targetting foreign tourists, so do your research online first. The best you can expect is good oil massages.

Goa, Pondicherry, Sikkim and northeastern states are also quite safe. I would suggest to stick to cities and major towns during your initial months to get used to the way of life. It isn't safe to travel to rural regions of several states like UP/Bihar as a solo women traveler. So, if you want to go to such places, I strongly advise going in groups o people you trust.

Regarding treks, I suggest searching IndiaHikes. They have some good articles on DIY guides to trek at all parts of the country and if you prefer, you can travel with them as well.

"I am forwarding an interesting story about world economy. How valid is it? I leave it to you. Another whatsapp forward  But when Americans spend money in America, the money stays in America. But if you will spend money in India, most of this money will go out of India.
Example: Buy a IPhone product in America and India.  I get a feel this is snake oil logic. 

People need money to spend. Here currency is inr, so exporters would get paid in inr, and hence the Q may be to ask why is dollar so much more valuable and also why do Americans have so much more of it ? 

I have personally thought over what creates value at the very core and the answer always seems to me to be creation of new intellectual property in which US is the leader and will be for more time to come. 

As to why Americans have so much of it? I think it might be a very complicated Q and part of answer might be that they print it and also that lot of countries want to save in dollars and also invest in infrastructure creation in America... 
 This is not true on so many levels - the most obvious being that the spending habits of a nations's people has a very weak relationship (and even an inverse relationship sometimes) with the national debt. This is literally why macroeconomic indicators and microeconomic indicators should not be lumped or confused. Japan as a country is one of the most indebted nations with a debt to GDP ratio of 240%, while US is at about 106%. But it is just an indicator. If a government is borrowing mostly from its citizens in the form of government bonds (like the US) its not a big deal. If a government is borrowing to finance projects which will lead to economic growth, it can pay off those debts and have surplus left over in the future so its not a problem. For example, Greece's peak debt to GDP ratio of 160% was a huge concern because the economy was not growing, while the Japanese economy has strong fundamentals so they can keep borrowing.

Also if you look at it from the other side, China basically needs new jobs every year to feed its people. It is an export driven economy that pays for these jobs by selling the massive amount US dollars it gets from these exports for RMB (Yuan) that it then gives to its people. But this increases the supply for US dollars which left unchecked would overvalue the RMB and China would then lose its competitive edge in the manufacturing market. So to always keep the Yuan slightly undervalued it buys enough long-term US government bonds. These bonds also act as low risk investments that keep its portfolio diversified against the high risk manufacturing projects that it takes on in Africa for example.

So platitudes like 'Saving is sin, and spending is virtue' might sound reasonable and be applicable at a microeconomic level, but does not work at all when you are talking about countries. 'Keep your investment portfolio diversified' is a better saying that applies to virtually all levels of consumers. Hmm I don't know why people in the thread are thinking this is some mind blowing non mainstream line of thought.

OP can be easily explained as a version of Keynesian economics and demand side economics. Put money in the pockets of workers and the economy will grow because they spend more than they save. 

https://www.investopedia.com/terms/k/keynesianeconomics.asp

https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/040915/what-demandside-economics.asp Looks like another attempt at emotional blackmailing Indians to give up their gold and other savings for a better “future”  The reason why everyone ""invests"" in Dollars is because that is the currency for oil trade.

Unless you have a specific agreement like India and Iran, the default currency to buy crude oil is USD.

So everytime, every country wants to buy oil, it has to buy USD from the market and then pay the oil supplier. This keeps the USD strong compared to other currencies.

Also, the reason Americans consume so much is because they don't have strict import laws to ""protect"" the local industries like we do. The buyers in the US are free to choose what quality of products they want to use. And usually it's an imported products that is priced better than a local brand.

If we (India) remove import duty, we fear that Tata and Mahindra will die out. While the US takes it as a challenge and makes newer Chevys and Fords and, ahem, Chryslers.

"Why is the proposed 'bail in' clause not being discussed?  Reposting from my earlier comment:

BloombergQuint explains it well here:

https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/2017/11/28/should-depositors-fear-the-new-financial-resolution-deposit-insurance-bill

ELI5 version: Say you are a bank and you have given out money to several entities. Say those entities are not able to return the money, so they become NPAs. What can a bank do in this situation?

* Do a bail out. 
* Do a bail in. 
* Go bankrupt and close down. 

The point of note here: These are the last steps that a bank  takes, there are several ways that the bank tries to recover money at first - selling the assets of the entity, selling the entity itself, issuing bonds to raise more money and avoiding bankruptcy, not issuing profits as dividends and absorbing them to solve NPAs, downsizing and firing staff etc. Infact, in the new bankruptcy laws which is already in place, the banks have the power to take over the entity and try to turn it around so that it becomes capable to pay off it's debts. Incase that's not possible, it can sell the entity itself and keep all the proceeds to itself, which is what's happening for some of the steel companies in India which form the largest NPAs. The promoters and owners of the said entity don't get any profits from the sale. 

With great bankruptcy laws, banks in developed nations are able to recover upto 60 % of NPAs. However, rates in India are low, only 20% of NPAs get recovered. 

Now imagine a hypothetical scenario where the bank has no other option but to use the last three options I discussed above. So what should it do?

With a bail out - the tax payers of the country give money to recover the bank. 

With a bail in - the depositors and customers absorb some losses and give money to recover the bank. 

Note: Whether a bail out or a bail in, it's the people who are going to pay for the recovery of the banks. Also note, every person who participates in an economy is a tax payer - whether of direct tax or indirect tax. 

Now comes the interesting part: RBI has insured all deposits in the banks to a sum of 1 lakhs. So if a bank goes bankrupt, you are insured a sum of upto 1 lakh and you can claim that amount from RBI. 

So what has changed in this law? Two things:

* The law has given the power to RBI to change the insured amount. This is necessary because when this 1 lakh insurance limit was set, it was in 1970s and it used to be a big amount then. 
* **Insured deposits do not come under bail in. ** Which is why the title that banks can wipe out your money is incorrect. 

What changes for you because of this law:

* Previously, without bail in option, if the bank was not bailed out, you could have claimed a maximum of 1 lakh from RBI as insured money. With bail in option, that remains the same, your insured amount of 1 lakhs is what you can claim if the bank goes bankrupt. 

* In extreme screnio, banks can take your deposits and bail in with that to save itself. However, if that point arrives, a bank going bankrupt is more disastrous than a bail in. 

Either way, people pay if bank get unrecoverable NPAs, either through taxes, or through deposits. Which is a better option is a point of debate. What's not a point of debate is that we need to strengthen our financial institutions, keep them away from political influence - one way is privitizing them, and get more robust bankruptcy laws application.  Because it is pointless fear mongering.

We had this discussion a few days ago. What do you think happens today if a Bank fails and the government does not choose to bail it out?

You lose all your money above 1 lakh and go sue the Bank.

The Bail In clause actually benefits you because you're going to be placed above bond interests because those Bonds will be used to recapitalize too, before coming after your deposits.

The matter of contention is that now the entity comes under scrutiny before actual failure, and that is a *good* thing. My bone with it is why do we need a separate corporation instead of empowering the RBI, but that's a different matter.

Seriously, what do you think the laws are today?

 So, if a bank has rising NPAs people will move accounts to a safer bank. Then the bank collapses on itself, from reducing accounts and rising NPAs? Because baa baa black sheep,have you any fools?


Yes sir,yes sir,one country full. This is extremely scary. Banks give huge loans to the wealthy and influential. They default and to cover the bank's losses, the depositers also take a 'hair cut'. For the money they forego, they are given equity in the bank which in most cases, will not be anywhere close to the extent of deposit used in 'bail in'. Same thing happened in Cyprus Bhaiyya bail out aur bail in nahi, gau out or gau in. Hamar dau dau bachiya hai. Kuch saal baad gau ban jaayi. Because There is no provision of cancellation of Deposits. 'Bail In' exempts Deposits and other liabilities while there is also provision of Insurance on every deposit account so your money remain safe. Bail In is the last resort to get you the money Depositors and Creditors apart from ₹100000 insurance money. As usual media is peddling fake news.

Can't believe people just automatically upvote anything anti modi without even reading the BS in the post. So it wasn’t since the time of Indira Gandhi?

Modi is the result of the bullshit spawned by Congress over the years. Now, we have the other side corrupting the system to suit their agenda.

I don’t like Modi but I hate Congress worse.  The same SC CJI ruled in favour of AAP govt. in the LG- AAP turf war. 
And why are you blaming Modi, SC judges are appointed by collegium, not our PM Yes, there are several videos and reports which are not from the left per se. its even from centerists who argue this.

Also, you forgot Electoral bonds, which is completely annonmyous way of paying a party.

What factions usually do is try to remove blame from Modi, and pin in on the pre-existing system, absolving the leadership of everything. This is a problem because, the leaderships' inaction, rather...its tweeks to more streamline the process, is in cahoots with the pre-existing system of corruption.

Technically, the present government has not done as much damage as previous ones, but small steps it has taken to legalize corruption, will lead our nation to further ruin.

I am sure that's what our founding fathers would have wanted - ""My father, let my country be led to ruin"" (/s) Generally I think that the more autocratic a government is the more corruption flourishes. This is because fewer people have more power (and so can do bigger scams) and because they face less risks of repercussions.

"What are my options?  Honestly the job market wouldn't see you as a good candidate if you self educated yourself in something but have experience in something else. At least the big companies won't entertain your programming self studies or MOOCs if your past work experience of 8 years is not relevant. 

You could try putting every project, every course on github, making your skills as knowable as possible on blogs and/or YouTube. This would be my suggestion. Enter hackathons for programming, kaggle for AI, get your graphic designs up on display something like that. Anything noticeable. Programming like Java shouldn't be super tough to pick up initially. But of course the nuances are hard.

The thing is, the big companies trust other big companies to mould you similarly to how they want you. So if you're already moulded by another big company you're ready to start in theirs. If not... they don't really trust you and can't judge you well enough in interviews. It's risky for them.

"The Kerala Model  Damn you OP, I was expecting some mallu models

(ノಠ益ಠ)ノ Regarding the high crime rate in kerala: 

https://youtu.be/2EH6OWMUCnI

You may skip to 3:45 Every state has dependence on something. I just think that Kerala does the right things with their money. The risk associated with this source is questionable but the money itself is used in improving HDI and not just 'bijness' related indicators.

Their economy and employment is dependent on three things mainly - tourism, gelf and Bangalore. Maybe their next target itself is to reduce this dependency.

The debate is very nuanced with guys like Bhagwati and Sen arguing the merits of Gujarat and Kerala models. With economics, there are no right answers. It's just whatever works.

Now let's take the other extreme - Haryana. The economic indicators are off the charts. But people still hold onto their outdated beliefs and some parts of the state also has law and order problems and is regarded unsafe for women. Now is this development and is it sustainable? >Kerala started out with 47% literacy in 1951, at a time when UP had 12% and the India-wide average was 18.33%. 

And why was so UP being in Ganga belt had historically been a rich place of poor people . Kerala had better indicator at independence bcoz it had  and has better society . And still today UP is a highly divided society .


For Japanese miracle and their industrialization , their homogeneity and social structure played an important foundation part  As a Keralite, I find the chest thumping to be a ridiculous show-off at best and the communist revisionism to hijack all the achievements at the worst. We will be facing dire issues when the middle-east slows down significantly. I personally know so many young men pinning their futures on some small job in the gulf. 

Trade unions must be reigned in and the ease of doing business has to improve. It won't happen overnight, but that will be the greatest thing the current left government can do and only a left government can do.

I really wish there was a way for me to return to my hometown. As of now, the only way I can sustain my current income if I move back is to go freelance, and that is being optimistic. To be fair, a govt can do investment in social welfare without being communist. Just look at what Mamata Banerjee is doing in Bengal, despite me hating her, she has done some good work in mgnrega, improving the hospitals from their dismayl state, and overall improving rural infrastructure. 

The fiscal deficit and high debt you mentioned was common in communist govt of Bengal too. When the Left left, we had a high debt of over 1.5 lakh crore, and the current govt is not doing anything either to reign it. 

My main issue with Kerala model is that it can't be implemented anywhere else. It works for them, good, but we need some other way to lift other states. I like breaking big states to smaller, and then working on them. Likewise, we can produce replicas of Goa which have decent social infrastructure as well as good enough ease of doing business to lift people up.  One of the less spoken advantages of Kerala is that most of its population is either in the cities or live in close proximity to cities. I believe factors like high HDI and low IMR are because of this. 

But regardless of what brought about its high development, I think the Kerala model cannot be adopted by rest of the states. If we are looking to emulate, I guess the Tamil Nadu model of socialism has proven successful. TN may not be Kerala, but is often #2 or #3 on most counts. Again, one advantage that TN has/had that a state like UP does not is that Madras has been a prominent administration city since pre-independence. But I think any benefits from that are minimal at the moment.  Radicalization is a problem in Islam itself. I don't think the rates of radicalization are more in kerala in comparison to an equivalent Muslim population of that number elsewhere.  Do you have a source for this? While OP is raising legitimate points about Kerala’s economy, you seem to be missing the whole point about Kerala model. 

Kerala model is that It has achieved very high material Quality of life/human development indicators, despite being A low income state.

The reason it is called a model is because it is unique. Pretty much everywhere else in the world economic growth and quality of life or Human development go hand-in-hand but strangely Kerala Managed to improve material quality of life with little economic growth.

By arguing that Kerala’s economic growth track record may be considered abysmal, though a fair point, you are only reinforcing the concept of Kerala model.

Nobody calls Kerala an economic miracle, everybody knows it is not. 

Is it a replicatable model? Maybe not. Is it the key to solving the problems across the country? Definitely doesn’t seem like it. 

Has historic circumstances contributed? Perhaps. But historic and geographic reasons also limits its economic potential too. So that is argument that cuts both ways. 

Now, i would say it is facetious to argue that the outcomes have solely been due to the gulf boom, Because the impact of the gulf boom on Kerala really began only in the late 80s. 

Kerala Declared hundred percent literacy in the early 90s, which would not have been possible without strong government policies over the years. 

Also some of the places with most gulf NRIs, such as Malappuram, are actually some of the most backward areas in Kerala.  


And to give credit to the Travancore royal family is laughable, because if that were the case then many regions in Southern Tamil Nadu today was part of the  erstwhile Travancore kingdom. While, parts of the Travancore kingdom that is in Kerala have done extremely well, parts that are with Tamil Nadu have yet to catch up. Also Travancore kingdom is probably covered less than 30% of modern Kerala. 

It is very clear that the most significant government policy that laid the foundation for this transformation was the massive wealth redistribution program launched by the first Kerala government, which was a communist government. 

So, what has the Kerla model achieved? Fewer children are dying, fewer mothers are dying, there are fewer illiterate people. More and more people are getting skilled, hence are able to find higher paying jobs, albeit, elsewhere. I would argue that we are yet to yield dividends of Kerala model. 

So, yes it is a model. Is it the best model? it is hard to say. Has it its own advantages? Oh yes definitely.

"I find R/India circlejerking too much over Shashi Tharoor whenever he reproaches the evils of the British Raj. Here is an alternative perspective from Gurcharan Das [non political]  Wow. TLDR? [deleted] [deleted] I don't think thats what Tharoor is really talking about. More from the perspective of:- Hitler is taught to be an ""evil"" guy now. In germany as well. Yet, Britain has mostly whitewashed the horrors they've committed in what they teach to their own kids. Continuing the same stuff.  

IMHO, he's raising awareness about the atrocities that they've committed, and thats something I can get behind. I think Tharoor's main goal is to educate the modern Western masses about some of the harsher realities of colonialism, that they conveniently leave out in their history text books. This was an interesting counter narrative as well. Das essentially wrote the same thing in 'India Unbound'. But I don't think it really contradicts Tharoor's claims . Everyone of Das' arguments are well corroborated in partly being responsible for holding ""India"" back but he let's the Brits go Scott free.

Yes, there were individual entrepreneurial success stories (too few benefited). Yes, the European institutions enabled the industrial revolution and yes, the caste system was responsible. But without a ""Indian"" structural head who could've changed things or we could've had an enlightment (a historical what-if), the colonial masters simply gave  no chance for growth. That carries a lot of culpability. 

The drain theory is definitely true. The EIC was paying 400,000 pounds to the crown since 1765 apart from the ""gifts"" to Parliament all sourced from India. They took advantage of Aurgazeb's tax exemption. The Marathas, Nawab of Awadh and Hyderabad's Nizam all had to pay substantial amounts annually to the French and EIC well before 1857. Asaf-ud-daula paid 7.6 million rupees annually just to be recognised Nawab in 1797. The point is, the money could've been spent on subjects or institutions and maybe we wouldn't be as poor as we are now.

A book came out last year called ""Selling Empire: India in the Making of Britain and America, 1600-1830"" which demonstrates the centrality of India--both as an idea and a place--to the making of a global British imperial system. Essentially, the new world was discovered *because* Columbus was searching for riches in India. 

He makes the argument that in the run-up to the American Revolution, the East India Company played a visible and disturbing role. In his view, Americans’ awareness of the Company’s conquests in India, and the establishment of an authoritarian government there, evoked the fear of a shared place for Indians and Americans in a corrupt and “despotic” empire . Following the Revolution, America’s connection with India paradoxically expanded, as reflected in part by the continuing appeal of Indian consumer fashions. Much of it, however, arose fortuitously out of the extended British wars with France from 1794 onward; as a neutral power, the United States was well situated to take advantage of trading opportunities denied to others. By 1806, India had contributed 4 percent of U.S. imports, and Americans commanded much of the Continental European market for Indian goods.

The Nehruvian disaster is irrelevant for judging the British period.

Taking information from the article itself, I think we can still blame the British for not letting India join the industrial revolution.

This they did by creating:
Low literacy/education (In a modern economy, this alone will mean that you'll fail to compete.)

Unstable political environment/ low confidence (In an uncertain future, why will anyone invest time and capital.) There is a mention of low self confidence and lack of education being the reason Indians didn't moved toward industrialization. And he also mentioned that Indians had no money to buy anything at that time. Then how after 1947 suddenly things could have changed? Isn't these things require time especially a skills gained after education. I think once a generation of Indian educated enough in 1980's they automatically moved towards the industrialization solely on the basis of there skills. And of course we can't deny the poor government policies but I feel completely blaming them isn't right  a thing. Is there something wrong I have understood from this article? Saved for later. Too long to read right now. Let's just sum it up: The British did many good things and bad things.

Really good interview.  >Finally, I realise that the TL;DR post itself needs a TL;DR.

Ramdev is a shady dude Thanks. I had pre-ordered the book on Amazon the day it became available, but it hasn't yet reached me. I learned about the ebook on Juggernaut from your post and got a copy. I'm more than halfway through the book now, this guy is no swami, he's not even a hard nosed businessman, he's a mobster.

**Edit:** Finished the book a while back, thought I should update. Took less than three hours to read, was interesting enough to read in one sitting. Not badly written at all, saw the author went to Columbia to study journalism, it shows in the tight narrative and objective stance. It's clear that the author wanted to cover the less seen perspective, which makes this more of an investigative journalism piece than a biography. It's taken some effort to put this all together, but it's not a multi year ground breaking effort. Nevertheless very timely, and shows the murky underbelly. Lala Ramdev is incredibly ambitious, and since ambition is violence, he's quite ruthless and violent. It's a psych profile [probably true for many CEOs and top politicians who have all been found to have psychopathic tendencies.] (http://time.com/32647/which-professions-have-the-most-psychopaths-the-fewest/)

It's a rags to riches story of ruthless ambition. Also an example of what yoga without yama/niyama (dos and don'ts) can do, it can provide incredible energy for mischief. Even before reading this, I never trusted in Ramdev as a spiritual godman, but still didn't actively disapprove of him since I just considered him to be a businessman.
But reading your post has made me realize that he is a pretty terrible human being who feeds off the faith of the gullible.

Thanks for the post mate. You have completely changed my perception.

TL;DR. ""New shit has come to light."" I do not know the truth behind the facts presented in that book but based on what you have written it seems that this Baba knows how to gain people's trust and then punishes them for trusting him. In a way he is teaching them all a lesson for trusting him by exploiting their weaknesses.

For example, Shankar Dev and Karamveer seem to have had very high ideals and when they wanted to hand pick somebody to carry on their legacy out of all the people they chose Ramdev. It shows that these people were terrible at judging who is a real disciple and who is not. This is fucking scary man... Fuck! OP, this is great.

"Indian govt banning investment from China is yet another ""masterstroke"" by Modi - this time, to kill startups.  China is a snake dressed as a puppy. Best blocked. Look how the CCP is protesting now saying that India's protections violate the WTO rules. Where were the WTO rules when lakhs of crores worth of state sponsorship was given to CCP companies to dump products everywhere at prices lower than the raw material costs, simply to kill the domestic manufacturers? You cannot even get a Diwali lamp that's made in India these days, and it is because local makers cannot compete with the state subsidized manufacturing and dumping by China. 

Honestly, if a startup is really good, money will flow in from everywhere. Companies like Paytm are not real innovations. They are data mining operations. Great startups have marquee investors from US, Singapore, Korea etc. We don't need China. 


They have taken over companies all across EU and Australia. They sneak in, then buy it completely. > Paytm to Zomato, Byju’s, MakeMyTrip, Swiggy Ola, Big basket

> Why did mere 0.2% additional investment in HDFC trigger the govt so much? 

HDFC is a [systemically important bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemically_important_financial_institution). In short, a bank, insurance company, or other financial institution whose failure might trigger a financial crisis. They are colloquially referred to as ""too big to fail"". Owning every % of HDFC is like owning a part of Indian economy, So obviously Indian Govt. will loose their shit if China invest more in this company. > Indian startups are among the most innovative companies in the world, and have recorded huge growth despite negligible assistance from the Modi government.

Dude, what the hell are you smoking? Indian startups are mere copycats of Western businesses! Flipkart copied Amazon, Ola copied Uber, Oyo copied Airbnb, PayTM copied Paypal, Zomato copied Yelp, the list goes on!

> 1. Why did mere 0.2% additional investment in HDFC trigger the govt so much? Owning 1.1% of HDFC gets China no say in any matter related to HDFC.

HDFC Ltd. is a lending company with deep ties to the banking sector. Even a 1% stake lets them get into the board, and they get veto powers. A CCP-owned firm having veto powers in one of the largest banking organizations of the country? No, thanks!

> 2. What kind of thought was put into this decision? It's clear that Finance Ministry doesnt put much thought into most of its policies (as evidenced by the downward spiral of economy and key finance ministry portfolio holders more interested in goli maro than economy). But is killing startups during an already fast growing global pandemic crisis really required?

While I agree that the finance ministry is daft in regards to various policy matters since it is controlled by the PMO; a veto against China won't kill startups. What kills startups are their lack of revenue management. Almost all startups are running in losses! How long will financers back these companies? Businesses exist to generate profit; yet most modern startups don't have those plans in sight (both Indian and foreign startups as well).

> 3. What kind of relief will India provide to its startups? Indian govt coffers are already running on fumes. Just to deal with Coronavirus disaster, billions of dollars would have to be spent by the govt that will leave little room for other reliefs. Infact the only way govt can survive is by taxing already tax payers even further. In this situation, is Indian govt equipped to provide any relief to startups?

Why should government systems provide financial aid to companies, both startups as well as established businesses? That whole line of thinking is wrong in my opinion. Unfortunately, the worst precedent was set when government bailed out banks during the 2008 financial crisis. Yes, businesses have been hurt by Covid-19; and a lot of them have incurred losses as well. Isn't it part of running a busines? If startups don't learn to not put all their eggs in one basket, the government cannot help it. The most a government can do (and I am not talking BJP / Congress here) is relax taxation and bureaucratic mess of paperwork to ease startups to get back to their feet. I don't think India has banned investments. They just made it mandatory to seek government approval before its done.

If China is pissed they can take it up theirs.

You just need to look at Australia, if you want to see what giving China free rein could mean in a tough situation. What are the anti takeover laws you are talking about? Do you have an example of any country implementing it successfully? 

Not in a harsh tone, just curious. I do not understand why everyone thinks they are financial experts and the people running the country with advisors who are some of the best experts in their fields are all idiots.

As for answering your question, you have to think bigger and broader than just startups, as an effect of coronavirus there is going to be a recession and most industries would be going into red, so as to avoid hostile takeovers and keep the industries safe the decision was taken.

"Since some people actually believe Mamata is worse than Modi, lets's see how she compares to the other CM candidates from the other parties of the state.  >Unfortunately 9 years is too short a time to right what happened over the past 60 years.


Same excuse the bhakths giving for Modi.


I like your interesting take on Mamata where you've conveniently ignored the following:


1. Corruption - Only Mamata bhakths believe that she and her party members had nothing to do with the Sarada scam. Or the other chit funds. The cases are still pending and the money is totally gone. Whatever money was returned to the few was taken out from the state funds. A bridge collapsed in the middle of city and tmc government didn't bat an eye. Trifala scam has started again. There's too many to list here, but do check what Abhishek Banerjee has been doing for the last few years. 


2. Intolerance - Calling students Maoists and arresting them. Arresting professors and putting them behind bars without fair trial for posting a simple meme. Police violence in JU. Torturing civil service officers to suicide. 


3. Lies and Jumla - park street rape case. The accused escaped and his gf who aided his escape was taken into the party. Mamata assassinated the character of the rape victim just to give a clean chit to the accused. Everyone forgot that it seems. In this regard, care to elaborate what's she's doing with the covid 19 testing to hide the numbers? Social media is rife with tells of how people are being turned away from hospitals, and that's not bjp propaganda. I'm receiving news from my friends who are doctors that there's state sponsored propaganda to hide the numbers. Mamata even went as far to forcefully audit the deaths to co-morbid conditions so that the covid report can be suppressed. Funny thing is, unless there's co-morbid conditions, you'll not even die from covid, that doesn't mean it's not spreading.


4. Industrial output - pray tell what Mamata has done to improve the state's industrial output? Where are the jobs? We've all been hearing the empty lies from the biswa bangla summit, how many of the those projects ever came to fruition?


5. Minority appeasement - while Modi is trying to get rid of muslims, Mamata is doing the opposite, going as far as to ignore the criminal elements in the society to pander to that votebank. The attack on doctors that sparked a protest across the country was fueled by the simple fact that Mamata didn't have the guts to arrest the criminals because they were Muslims, even when the rational Bengali Muslim community tried denouncing them over and over. She has given the statement that those who came from Bangladesh and have voted are now citizens even if they have come recently, what the fuck? Mamata doesn't get to decide who gets citizenship. We don't want Bangladeshis here, no matter if they are Hindu or Muslim. Her government had even shielded war crime convicts just to get some brownie points. Why?


There's no difference between Modi and Mamata except the fact that while the first one is trying to get rid of the Muslims, the second one was trying to alleviate them to a godlike status (one imam from a Bengali masjid gave the statement a few years ago that the Muslims will decide who gets to become the CM of WB). Other than that, the lies and jumla are just as widespread, the corruption just as deep. The only reason Mamata gets away with all this is because Bengal has became irrelevant in the national stage. No one gives a shit. Else she's just as corrupt and authoritarian as Modi. And if talking about the developments, these are all being done with a single strategy. Destroy Bengal's industrial output, evict all the educated folks, so whoever left becomes solely dependant on the state for their livelihood. Meanwhile she and her goons can continue ruling the state like the left has done for last 3 decades. That's all there is to it.


Bengali's have no hope left. It's TMC or BJP, and both are cancerous in their own ways. Only chance is for an Arvind Kejriwal to rise, but that's probably never gonna happen. Most educated and literate bengali's are leaving the state, who's gonna rise to the occasion? There should be a trade off between socialism and Capitalism.

How’s the popularity of BJP among Bengalis ? I heard they are gaining ground in some spots and local polls . 

Do you think communists supporting the BJP will affect TMC much ? Okey let's list pros and cons of Mamata and TMC

Pros: 1) Mamata is authoritarian but still TMC regime is way more free than the previous CPM rule. It was possible to openly post against TMC in social media. Such open criticism of the government or party was impossible for most people earlier.

2) Rural infrastructure is developed a lot in comparison to previous regime. Roads are improved a lot.

3) The police and the government offices are more active.

4) Smaller crimes like eve teasing and theft are reduced in my experience.

5) The government and the party is secular and not racist  at all which is a big plus point in todays India.

6) Economy of the state is improved.

7) Government officials and police has more power than the previous regime where they were puppets of the local party office.

Cons: 1) One woman party and government. Due to her tendency to control everything her government is full with people who are good for nothing and totally useless. She doesn't like people who would argue with her.

2) Her intolerance against opposition.

3) TMC is full with goons and politicians whose sole aim is to make money by hook or crook.

4) ""Appeasement"" of big groups of people for vote. Yes, not only Muslims, she tried to appease every groups who are united enough. The all India media do not show her ""appeasement"" of Hindu Matua people who are a big votebank. She tried to appease both Mullahs and Brahmin Pandits by offering them money. She also gave money to clubs and durga pujas.

5) Various scams like Sharada, Trifala etc.

6) State government employees are angry with her due to  not giving DA and other allowances at par with the central.

7) Reduction of government employments and some questionable recruitments.

> “Do Phillips curves conditionally help to forecast inflation?”, a 2017 paper by Michael Dotsey, Shigeru Fujita and Tom Stark published by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, however, argues that central bankers may be using the wrong economic model to frame policy. **The authors argue that there is no real trade-off between inflation and unemployment, as assumed by generations of economists, as models based on the Phillips curve have a poor forecasting record. This should not be surprising.**   
>  
>The stagflation of the 1970s proved quite convincingly tha**t high unemployment and high inflation can very well co-exist**. Also, wages may not be as rigid as many economists assume, which means that they could adjust downward quite comfortably in many cases. Lastly, loose monetary policy, apart from ramping up inflation, often also causes structural distortions in the economy which lead to higher unemployment. Given such complexity in an economy, any effort to micromanage it may well be a fool’s errand.

Also, the issue of unemployment in India is a structural one and can not be dealt with making small changes via Quarterly Monetary Policy Committee meetings. 

The issue lies with the fact that large amount of labour force depends on the Primary Sector which is worrisome as Primary sector does not contribute to GDP commensurately. The RBIs been pretty hawkish in the past few years to control Inflation except the last February meeting. But I don't think they will go hard on the liquidity scenario now.

Coming to the unemployment inflation relation, remember Phillips curve isn't always true. There were multiple instances of stagflation. So,

RBIs been hawkish on inflation? Yes

"An Honest Conversation About Demonetization  I do not agree with your summation. As a small business owner myself, my overall takeaway is that it was pretty detrimental for the growth for many of us. 

Earlier I was supportive of a move to eliminate black money but I saw my own income drop by 70% as well as many of my friend's startups failing or forcing enterpreneurs to get jobs instead of trying to pursue their ideas. Instead of getting tax rebates and incentives, if small business provide jobs, we were burdened with thr complicated process of gst and huge fall of demand from the medium-paying client.

"ITS LOCK ON for Indian Real Estate  Okay. Cigarettes are 45 a piece here. Can't afford groceries if the lockdown goes on for another month. Sure, suggest us to buy cheap properties. Fucking real estate assholes. To a hammer,every problem looks like it can be fixed by a nail. Fact of the matter is real estate is a bad investment in India. You may buy a house if you wish to live in it. However as an investment vehicle with pitiful rental yields of 2-3% due to over supply in most cities, it is a renter's market.

Buying land on the outskirts where the city will grow into is a much better investment compared to buying built real estate. REAL ESTATE SHOULE BE THE LAST THING one should be investing in , in the next 12-15 months.

1. Rental yields from a rented home would barely be enough to cover the EMI of a housing loan ( let alone act as a secondary source of income ) 
I'm




2. Houses are highly illiquid investments. With the kind of job losses predicted over the next 12-15 months , one needs or have a solid savings pool to be easily accessible. If there are no takers for your house , you will have virtually no  liquidity on hand to provide for emergency expenditures ( mom and dad falling ill, deferred jobs for your sons and daughters , layoffs for you etc ) 



3. Post corona,  the reverse migration that has happened will not see most migrants returning any time soon. Most villages are self sufficient and labor migrates for better opportunities to cities. There will be  scant opportunities  post corona recovery and labour shortages will not be accompanied by commensurate wage increase as real estate firms will not be able to afford higher project outflows for labour. 

So expect massive delays on projects that are under construction . 


A large number of real estate firms will wind up. Quite a few will be stuck in litigation . You money may be stuck and you may never even see an asset. 


We are going through a highly irregular time. This is not a good time for such stupid investment decisions

True that loans were high in that time too. But when you are in economic boom you're supposed to give loans to companies and take calculated risk. But now the loans are about 5-6 time higher, unemployment is 45 years high, bad loans have gone 3 to 9%. The bubble have been burst.

There are several votebanks in operation for BJP. There is the core RSS votebank, the Modi votebank, the development votebank, a newly minted SC/ST/OBC votebank and so on. The development votebank is fast disappearing, true. And probably turning into an anti Modi votebank. But the rest are new, believers in **what Modi has been doing since 2014** and they remain steadfast.

End of the day, the total anti BJP voter share in India is higher than BJP's vote share, all put together. But there is no one to bring those votes all across India against BJP. There is no leadership, no unity, no clear strategy. I like your optimism The fundamental truth that I have learned about Indian politics is that it is dependent not on ideology, policy or party allegiance but largely on cult of personality. We have had people like Bal Thackeray who was never elected to any position but controlled the politics of one of the largest states and one of the most important cities of the country for decades. Gandhi's,  Jaya Lalitha, MSG, Mamta Banerjee the list goes on and on. 

Modi has created a cult of personality for himself that even opposition candidates are fearful of attacking him directly (rather than trading barbs with Amit Shah or BJP MLA's). Until an opposition party with cross national muscle has a leadership figure who can cultivate a cult of personality around himself to oppose Modi, there will be no real power vacuum at the national level.

Congress is dead behind Rahul Gandhi, no other opposition party has a nationally relevant figure. Future I could see is with AAP/Kejriwal who has moulded himself into the archetype of middle-class Indian man, but AAP have years if not decades of work ahead of them to build a national party rather than a regional one. Lauda kuch nahi hone wala. This country is full of chutiyas. BJP will win again at the national level because Congress has shat the bed. I so hope somehow Kejriwal sir does well in Delhi again in the next 4 years and he can form a good opposition to the Nazi Sanghi squad. Middle class in India is tiny percentage of population. BJP knows they can take them for granted They had this great opportunity after revoking 370, win the confidence of people there, bring stability. Instead they installed a dick of a governer who is bullshitting and their ministers from other states giving statements that they will go and buy lands there.

"Anti-national, who me? Anti-""Hindu-Nation""-al, certainly!  I really really appreciate what you had to say. We are screwed on so many fronts that I honestly believe CAA js a good facade for the government to keep people engaged. Good news is that people are coming out in large numbers. 
The anti-muslim, anti-dalit anti-anything that isn't savarna Hindu (that too a very very specific type) policy is dangerous and the govt will unfortunately carry it out via the front or the back door.
I have also learnt a good lesson now- no party should get absolute power. The federal structure of government was designed by our founding fathers for a very sound reason. This is beautifully written. Can't disagree with any of it. Do you believe all of this will end in a remotely democratic manner? As in bjp's removal through elections? Or is it likely all bloodbath and genocide from here on culminating in civil wars and perhaps even foreign interference. As much as I agree with the spirit of this post, I completely disagree with the substance - or rather, your interpretation of India.

This isn't about _ghar wapsi_ or about Modi or, indeed, the BJP (scum though they are). This is about the creation of India as a political entity since before 1947. You see, it's this bit:

> And we certainly disagree on the definition of a ‘nation’. Hindu Rashtra and Hindu nationalism violate the Constitution. And turning India into a theocracy like Iran is what Modi and Shah and the Sangh Parivar machinery wants to do. Can Modi say under oath that he does not want to convert India into Hindu Rashtra? Can the bhakts say so?


The Constitution is only valid so long as the people of the country choose to hold it as valid. Pieces of paper have no power or sovereignty, they derive sovereignty from the people. The people have chosen to reject the constitution, because here's the kicker - the constitution and India are, and have always been, an inherently instable construct. The ideas of a secular India has always been deeply antithetical precisely because India is _not_ a nation by any rational definition of a nation. India is a hastily cobbled-together post-colonial creation that validates itself solely by creating an enemy - first the British Empire (justifiably so) and then Pakistan (unjustifiable) and Bangladesh (horrendously cruel).

It is these chickens that are, today, coming home to roost, because India's latent Hindutva was incredible easy to exploit. It always existed, it just lacked someone to point it out. And now that people are told that their Hindutva is threatened, the only justification they have always given themselves for the existence of their nation is collapsing, and they will shred the institutions meant to keep democracy safe just to keep their Hindu project safe.

India should never happened - the country was a post-colonial error, Britain's final kick to south Asia, and pretending it could ever be a secular country was a mistake. Secular nations are built on tangible cultures and cultural beliefs with concrete identities, like European nations, or Indian states. India was always Hindutva, and Hindutva was always India - all it lacked was the spark to set fire to the hatred and xenophobia that always existed, because that hatred is what justifies India's existence.

Tear the Republic down and demand statehood for your state, which is currently subjugated by India and Indianness. Sovereignty derives from a mandate of people living in consensus, and India will never have consensus that isn't phony and manufactured. That is the only way you can guarantee a better future for those not particularly religiously inclined. The idea of a Nation is based on commonality of language&culture. We preach ""Unity in Diversity"" and at the same time we also preach others to be ""Indian First"". These 2 messages are contradictory, why do we have to forgo our cultural identities to be an ""Indian"" if being Indian is just embracing the diversity?   Therein lies the ***real*** problem, the so called National Politics is stuck in a time capsule of North Centric Post-Partition Hindu-Muslim conflict. There is no nuance or logic to this narrative, BJP considers Hindu Nation as a foregone conclusion based on Partition whereas the other side doesn't have any retort other than ""let's not be a Hindu Pakistan"".

Liberals have lost the ideological battle because they're living in their own little worlds where they imagine India to be something its not. Majority of Indians don't give a damn about Progressive liberal beliefs and are drawn towards Charismatic leaders who talk in platitudes. What is the alternative to Modi? RAGA? Secularism is a noble State policy but it cannot be the only basis for a Nation. The ONLY ideological challenge Hindutva currently faces is Nativism from states such as Tamil Nadu&Bengal. Assamese opposition to CAB is also the same phenomenon, Assamese speakers have fallen below 50% in their own state and they don't want to fall any lower than that. 

>Forget Hindu texts, they don’t even have to study the Constitution

Liberals have spent the better part of 70+ years deconstructing and pointing out all the flaws of Hinduism but have done little to no attempt at highlighting the GOOD aspects of Hinduism to create a positive liberal Hindu identity. BJP has exploited this Hindu Identity vacuum by claiming that they understand&respect the good aspects of Hinduism,  people who would've sided with Liberals now side with BJP because they ""respect"" Hinduism, however superficial it may be. You should read [this article](https://www.livemint.com/Opinion/jyzFxtxjd2iGQPqA3mgOfN/Narendra-Modi-and-the-mystery-of-the-Hindu-Left.html) for more details. 

>Islamophobia

You're playing right into BJP's hands by using this term. BJP can&will use an UNO reverse card and label you as HinduPhobic.  **BottomLine:**You CANNOT defeat Hindu Identity politics by appealing to secularism&constitution ad nauseam.  You have to create a political Liberal Hindu identity in opposition to their bigoted one and market it to the masses. That is the only way i can see Hindutva going down. In summary:

1. BJP wants to change India into Hindu Rashtra
2. Muslims, Christians, Dalits and people who take the Constitution and secularism seriously will oppose that
3. Hence the BJP is hiding its intentions now; it has to change people's perceptions to normalize Hindutva even more than it is normalized currently
4. So how does it justify its fascism? By creating the conditions necessary for its justification
5. Muslims protesting in the streets will be portrayed as 'Pakistanis' or 'jihadis' who want India to become an Islamic state
6. Students will be seen as supporting Pakistan and jihadis, hence anti-nationals; they want to break India into pieces
7. Intellectuals are anti-nationals and urban Naxals, maybe even supporting China
8. Slurs such as these were merely slurs, not to be taken seriously, but now they'll become actual accusations (with perhaps legal, or extra-legal, consequences)
9. A conflict with Pakistan, or a very tangible fear of one, will help these slurs become real accusations
10. Thus BJP can justify further fascist policies like detention centres (which they deny now), and even unthinkable ones",Politics

"Moderate rightists vs extremist Savarkarites  Someone give this man a silver right fucking now! You're just clumping all right wing ideology together and calling these people ""Sarvarkarites"", which is misleading at best.

If you read Savarkar's writings, he never conflated Hinduism with Hindutva as you are trying to imply. Savarkar was actually pretty clear that religion had nothing to do with Hindutva. What he described as hindutva was a 'homogenous cultural identity of the subcontinent' according to him, which excluded the practices and traditions of Abrahamic religions because he believed those were foreign influences.

This is significantly different than the RSS, which is a primarily Brahmin Hindu organisation which believes in intra Hindu fragmentation as well, in other words, they do believe in castiest principles.

Things that you see nowadays such as all the Cow worship and beef ban, etc would not be a thing if people were following Savarkar.

Yes, both of these are far right ideological positions and I personally do not agree with any of them and think they are harmful to the country.

Just get one thing straight, it doesn't matter however targeted programmes you run, there is only one way to remove poverty, that is is rapid economic growth. Rising tide lifts all boats. You may not want it but the country needs 10 more Mukesh Ambani’s so that they can employ millions and thus there is some hope for some people.

Just don't give money in charity, but time also by volunteering for a cause you think you are good at. You don't know how many lives you cand drastically improve indirectly. I get confused with the term ""poor people"" offlate. At least, majority of those who qualify under the ""poor people"" category in cities don't really fall under this group as they earn really well, but in ""unaccountable ways"" aka without any taxation. How they spend their money is a different matter though. Most of these poor people earn a hand full in cities or don't earn because they are lazy (and not because of lack of opportunities). 

I feel every time I get exploited by these ""poor people"" rather than I exploiting them - it starts with almost everyone who fall into this BPL category and they will try to extract as much as possible from you or cheat you or want to get away with half baked work.

2. Create a consortium of all state-owned energy companies (BPCL, ONGC, IOCL etc) and provide support to setup a world scale massive solar panel and EV batter manufacturing unit in India
3. Train workforce on a war footing - construction, textiles, metal work, wood work etc.  
4. Show ""made in country"" labels on amazon and every e-commerce website on product thumbnail. Govt. should periodically collect numbers from e-commerce websites about percentage of made in India goods sold on their website to see the trends. The idea is good, but what it lacks is enforceability. Once we brainstorm all ideas, them what. How do we get these things out in the field? Utterly brainless idea.

"[AskIndia] Why do we have so much distrust of Businesses and Markets?  I remember, in the early 90s, my cousin brother endeavored to start a toy manufacturing company. It took a year and half to get all the permissions regarding land usage and taxes.

When he finally got to the stage of producing toys, he was already in losses as the interest for the loan kept pilling up (He had taken loans for machinery, which lay idle for a year, as he could not get permissions for manufacturing). When he finally started, he had to price the toys higher to offset some of the increasing debt. 

But then, if you remember, extremely cheap Chinese toys flooded the market (post-liberalization) and he had to declare bankruptcy after 4 years and close the company.

All because of red tapism.

This relates to point 5 of yours. I believe it has to do more with the Indian capitalists rather than to do with capitalism as such. 

Indian capitalists such as Nirav Modi and Ramalinga Raju who had successful business empire yet resorted to illegal activities. Sure there are illegal activities everywhere such as Enron scandal. But Indian businesses are too profit oriented, they treat their customers like shit. Before the entry of MNC in India, many Indian businesses had no policy of return even if the goods were damaged, they would instead blame the customer and government made slogans such as buyers beware. I still remember in early 90s how one of the big conservative textile shop in my city had a no return policy, they refused to take back damaged good they had sold us, I went to the same shop this year, they had a 15 days return policy what a surprise. 

MNCs changed all this but still people had a sour experience in general with these Indian capitalists add to the fact the MNCs remind them about East India company from our history text books. 

When the Indian businesses change their shitty outlook, Indians would start trusting them. Wtf....you cited Ambani and Adani as having no competition. Are you real?

Let's take the, telecoms sector and new entrant JIO. JIO came in and destroyed all the competition by lowering price that made most telecom companies either merge or go bust. 

A good Telecom regulator would have in some way prevented predatory pricing allowing fair competition to all players in this sector. **Every news be like - Government is God** I think the second point relates to affordability. Do people have choice with the amount of money they have or how many people with that kind of money do we have? The problem is not that we are taught capitalism incorrectly, the problem is that we are not taught capitalism at all. We have been having bad leaders for a really long time now. Political parties have been playing with the emotions of the poor by spreading lies about 'the wealthy'. They also know that it is easier to win an election by giving freebies and loan waivers than actually giving a damn about long term policies. The distrust is because of bad leaders hiding their incompetency behind lies Indian society is a low trust society as it is. I don't know the historical and sociological processes that have turned it this way, but it is what it is. It's made worse at the street level by the neighbourhood shopkeeper who isn't exactly a model of honesty anywhere in India. Even bigger businesses aren't exactly ethical with their customers, are they? Probably, the deep distrust of businesses stems from these two factors. It's not entirely unwarranted. A poor justice system and the role of influence in law enforcement means it's better to start with distrust and be overcautious, rather than trust and lose money.

At a government level, Nehru had the biggest influence in how governments look at businesses. As somebody who had seen the bad effects of colonial capitalist greed on our society, he was instinctively anti-capitalist. That attitude grew worse with Indira when highest levels of taxation on businessmen were imposed in the 70s and 80s. Naturally, they preferred to launder it to tax havens, and I think it is this image of tax-evading businesses that has been imprinted in the modern Indian bureaucrat's and citizen's mind. OMG dude, what have you done! You talked about...capitalism...here!? Oh god, prepare to be bashed and the downvotes.

Well jokes aside, the recent emergence of socialists in America and India are reactionary. Humans are shitheads and when they came to know this, since they can't blame humans, they are taking their anger out on the system - capitalism. Nice scapegoat. You have a problem with your relations? Capitalism. You have problem of diarrhea? Capitalism. The grocer charged you 2 rupees extra? Capitalism. The environment is degrading? Capitalism. As if Adam Smith wrote in his book to do all these.

The right wingers think ""government bad, corporates good"" while leftists think ""government good, corporates bad"". Both are right and wrong in their own way. Rightists understand that markets are important and that centrally planned economy and too much rules and regulations hurt the economy. And leftists are right in the sense that they understand that crony capitalism is harmful and that too many wrong risks can create depression/recession during which the government has to intervene (2008 global crisis). Currently, since right wing is on the rise, there is a reactionary socialist movement, that's all.",AskIndia
"Indian Economy.  Economy is political.

Ha Joon Chang says this in his book, Economics - A user's guide:

>In the old days, no country had a Ministry of Defence. They all had a Ministry of War because, well, war is what it really does. Patents used to be called patent monopolies, as they were (and still are) artificially created monopolies, even though they may be socially useful. So there you have it. Sometimes, an old, forgotten name conveys the essence of the thing it is describing much better than the modern one does.

&#x200B;

>The same goes for the old name of economics – **political economy**, or the study of political management of the economy. 

&#x200B;

>It is not possible to draw a clear boundary between economics and politics. This is because the very boundary of the market is in the end determined by politics and not by an economic theory – of whatever variety.

&#x200B;

>Before we even begin market transactions, we need (explicit and implicit) rules on what can be traded, who can trade them and how they can be traded in the market. All of these rules are restrictive in some ways, and therefore no market is genuinely ‘free’.\* And these ground rules cannot be determined by economic logic. There is no ‘scientific’ list of what should (or shouldn’t) be bought and sold in the market. The decision is a political one.

&#x200B;

>All societies keep certain things off the market – human beings (slavery), human organs, child labour, firearms, public offices, health care, qualifications to practise medicine, human blood, educational certificates and so on. But there is no ‘economic’ reason why any of these should not be bought and sold in markets. Indeed, all of them are or were legal objects of market transactions in different times and places.

I don't know what policies we should make. I would listen to people who have something to say about it instead of calling them anti-national just because they are calling a spade a spade. You asked not to make it political. But the law makers and decision takers need to be economically educated people in the first place. I don't care which color they prefer, they should have at least a master's or a compensable past record on the sector they are focusing on. Sorry, but how can we make this thread a non- political one ?

If the government in power doesn't have a clue or is not ready to frame new policies how can we revive our economy? Centralisation of power is bad for economic growth. The local governments should be given more freedom to form their own policies for economic development. It is a must especially for a big country like India.

A small city in India or a district can't do much to improve its local gdp. The city council or the Zilla Parishad don't have the sufficient funds or freedom to do it.

However, an US city can attract investors by giving them special tax breaks or cheap electricity. It is the same in China. The cities of China compete with each other to attract investment. They also have sufficient funds to develop and maintain their infrastructure without waiting for the help of the state or federal government. See ,when uve got an  FM sharing Ola /Uber   Whatts app  based forwards ,..or a Minister of Law and Justice bringing out Movie collection's to show that the economy is blooming ..or when uve got the PM making constant claims of turning India into a 5 trillion economy at 5% GDP .. there's little to no hope ..get in educated Economists ,who'll chart an actual roadmap ..if not , this is a sinking ship ..and we're all ferrying on it ..🚢 The recession is not purely cyclical, it's systemic. It's kind of an 'Indian made' calamity. We knew it was coming, just not that it would hit so soon(demo, and then gst aagravated it and it hit us way harder).

The failure of major-scale capitalism in certain sectors was expected. The failure of our 'socialist' undertakings was also expected. People have been talking about it for years. However, since it's expected, it's was manageable and avoidable.

But that's where we failed, since we elected the current government which led to the major economic mismanagement which is going on.

Those who say that only the current government caused it  are not completely right. This economic calamity we see was a natural thing coming, but some decisions made without long term analysis brought it way too soon. This is where we got fucked. Economic cycles happen, structural problems happen, and people are paid massive amounts of money to keep track of it.


In short: we knew it was coming, we didn't know we'll manage it SO BADLY. And yeah, you can blame the government. In my opinion the government should take a 3 step approach to tackle sluggish demand and slowdown

Step1:

Disinvest Air India, MTNL, BSNL to start with - This will reduce the fiscal deficit burden

Bring oil under GST ambit - not easy - Congress perished taking consent on this from the states

1 GST rate(preferably between 5% to 10%) and simpler filing norms for all items, The confusion and the frequent changes has caused massive uncertainty amongst small and medium scale traders and businesses, the MRP on all items should be inclusive of tax

Step2:

1. Do not bail out firms like DHFL, IL&FS etc - Let them bleed, it would cause trauma for 2 to 3 quarters but the lending will be vigilent and risk mitigating measures would be taken once the firms are aware that they are on their own and the government wont be bailing out on them and repercussions might include jail-time


2. Reduce taxation from 30%+cess to 20%+cess for anyone under 50 lac salary - this is the population which really go out and spend since they aspire to be rich, wear branded clothes, phones, buy automobile, buy houses. This would also lead to more tax filings and can lead to increase in tax collection


3.   Focus on Agrarian distress and start redistributing the money received from disinvestment and GST collection without putting burden on the fiscal targets

Step3:

1. Focus on education - cut defense spending and increase spending on primary and high school education - increase teacher salaries so that it becomes lucrative for people to take it up as a serious profession and bring innovation in this sector.

2. Bring government banks and cooperative banks under the RBI scrutiny and not state and union governments which are prone to corruption and money laundering pre and post elections

3. Cut Interest rates so that home-loans are in the range of 5-7% so that mortgage market and the biggest stable and secured source of income of banks is maintained

4. Reduce dependency on oil import, this is putting massive a dent in our GDP and also it would protect the environment but this is only possible once we have better rail gauges, high speed freight trains and loading and unloading costs and tariffs are marginalized.

There are many other measures government can adopt but given the short-term 4-5 year goals, If I see atleast half the measures getting adopted, we will see a lot of poverty alleviated. You asked not to make it political. But the law makers and decision takers need to be economically educated people in the first place. I don't care which color they prefer, they should have at least a master's or a commendable past record on the sector they are focusing on. > Where are we doing wrong?

This recent interview with a former advisor to the govt. Pronab Sen goes into some of this [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na2WDrRif3M) -

*... Sen says that the government doesn't seem to have a game plan to fulfil the 5 trillion economy promise. He explains what the government ought to do to revive the economy– by prioritising growth and employment generation in the rural sector. Sen also assess two flagship schemes of the Modi government – Mudra Yojna and  PM Kisan Yojna in this interview.*

>> IMO, one thing we are definitely doing wrong is not defining ""we"" properly. I'd prefer a ""we"" that treats each citizen of India as an individual with potential, and then come up with ways to self-help as well as help one another rise into better economic situations. This could be through local entrepreneurship ideas and partnerships, meetups, training camps, volunteering, skill sharing, side jobs, investments, even emigration. Rather than be stuck in a salaried job totally at the mercy of company and government finances.  It's better to have a weak centre with 29 states each of which is a standalone liberal economic powerhouse like norway or sweden. The scope of ""we"" should be maxed out at state level, and then scaled down to district, city, town, area and individual levels with different policies at each level.

And not a ""we"" where somehow the central government and its party's economic goals are treated as a proxy for each individual's economic well-being. Where it's treated as a given that if central government reaches their $5T goal, it implies all 1.3B individuals have $3.8K income. I have always viewed all our governments and their employees as being adversarial and small-minded (redtape, bribery, influence-peddling, threats, etc) rather than supportive, and this particular govt is more so than normal. There's no point in ideating policies for central government's benefit - let them solve their own shit.

"Why is Modi Considered a ""Hindu Nationalist"" and not a ""Hindu Globalist"" Instead?  When Modi and ""Hindu nationalism"" are used, people are referring to their *social* policies and thinking, not *economic* thinking. It's a form of ""[ethnic nationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_nationalism)"". It's a social concept, not an economic concept. Well, you may be on to something. I don’t have an answer for you but I looked up the meanings of globalist and nationalist. Did not clarify anything for me, but maybe someone else will pick something up.

glob·al·ist
noun: globalist; plural noun: globalists
a person who advocates the interpretation or planning of economic and foreign policy in relation to events and developments throughout the world.
a person or organization advocating or practicing operations across national divisions.

na·tion·al·ist
noun
a person who strongly identifies with their own nation and vigorously supports its interests, especially to the exclusion or detriment of the interests of other nations. Media, be it Indian or western, did not give the tag of Hindu Nationalist to Modi. Modi gave the tag ""Hindu Nationalist"" to himself and he did it well before Trump ran for the US presidential election. So, it is you who is presumptuous and ignorant, not the western media. To confirm it, here is the link to Modi's interview.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSp2WVorCM4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSp2WVorCM4) Well India's economical view is very different from China and USA. 

Easiest way to put it is, China and USA are competing to be the leaders, India is just competing to be the Secretary.

China and USA are competitors Chinese electronic  companies are slowly increasing their standards to meet the standards of US companies. Where as India just cares about Employment which you can get from few outsourced works.

"As an NRI, my personal view on the Serious emigration thread.  Awesome answer dude. You've put every point so precisely and there's no counter to any of that.

But, 'why would I come back to the place?' I'd give my answer to this. 

Because I am one of the few people who understand these issues.

Because I have power to solve one of these issues atleast to a tiny extent.

Because India sucking is as much a fault of the knowledged staying silent as that of the stupid ruling the roost.

(Bollywood answer alert!) Because it is my place! How many ever years I stay in any country, I wouldnt be considered as a localite. I wouldn't be able to say that this is my country. You said you are 28 and you have been in Germany for 8+ years, did you go there for your bachelors' degree? If yes, was the education free for bachelors'? 

Also, why doesn't Germany have a provision that parents of German(immigrant) citizens can also get German citizenship, like Canada?


Also, how is the treatment of Muslims in Germany, cause I heard the right wing is getting stronger there? Re Indian mangoes banned, it [was EU wide](https://www.livemint.com/Politics/fMXWwNQ0ZCL5ZjVAoGyhGI/EU-agrees-to-lift-import-ban-on-Alphonso-mangoes.html). There was also a ban on some vegetables which remained in place. Same reason: too much pesticide.

There have been similar alerts in [the UAE](https://www.thenational.ae/uae/uae-alert-over-pesticides-in-food-from-india-1.191984) and even the Indian press has [published stories](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/chemical-concoction-pesticides-in-veggies-and-fruits-harm-hyderabad-children/articleshow/65126763.cms) about it. Indians feel like people owe something to you. Indians take things personally. Like a comment here, a service would be considered as help and refused. When a service is refused - you know what it means. 

Fortunately, a service isn’t interpreted as help and thus not refused (as much as it is in India) abroad. I’ve noticed this and that’s just my two cents. The mentality of the people should change. Hyderabad doesn't have GEZ fee .... Germany has 😂😂 Nice post and agree with you. Currently living in South East Asia and I always want to move to Europe because of various reasons but the salaries and the taxes always make me think. Interesting read, OP.

I am curious, what is the status of racism against brown people in Germany considering the fact that there's been a sudden inflow in refugees over the past two years? 

Also, how long did it take you to get fluent in German? [deleted] Hi,
As someone living in Germany for quite some while and familiar other parts of Europe as well, which countries do you see having well established or a booming IT/tech industry at the moment/in the near future? 


Also, in terms of quality of life, ease of integration/emigration, and racial attitudes, and in general the culture how would you rank these countries?

Asking because I'm looking at emigrating to Europe as an option and would love to know your perspective. Ok, it seems like you're having a really good time in Germany and your quality of life is extremely well. I'm happy for you for that. You've risen out of the struggles of India and found some peace and breathing room in a more stable place. Good for you. I mean that.

Now, is it possible for you to return to Hyderabad permanently and still find a way to sustain yourself and those that depend on you financially? Considering you're a techie, there is a good (enough) market for software developers here so I think that is possible. If so, what is stopping you from doing that?

The reason I'm asking this is because you seem like an above average and sharp person. You've also had experience abroad which a lot of people do not have here. With all that in mind, your perspective and passion will be invaluable and the same goes for your siblings. If you're this passionate about your country while staying abroad, imagine what you could do for your country, your city or even just your locality if you were living here? So why aren't you here?

One reason could be that you really aren't financially stable enough to shift here, and that's ok. If that's not the case then the only reason left is that your passion is misplaced. You are only worrying about your ""home"" because you feel like you *should* or because you have family living there. When in reality you've subconsciously accepted your new home in Germany. It's either that or something else that explains why you're not in India trying to help with these problems you've mentioned.

See, all I'm hearing from your post is ""Please make the city more livable"". A plea coming from a non-resident Indian who will never go through the difficulties of achieving that goal (because he doesn't and won't live here) but expects the locals to do so. And inshallah we will do so, but not to set up cushions for you but to furnish our own cities.

Your post implies that us citizens are wilfully producing and promoting this black, ""shitty air"" that you mention when in fact, just in case you didn't know, we don't want this air just as much as you (actually, we don't want it more than you because we have to breathe it every day). This, if nothing else, keeps us motivated to change that and since we *are* living here we can directly try to change that.

So you can see why a rant about our ""shitty cities"" can sound hypocritical to our ears when we're trying to fix things here and someone who has just about none of a dog left in the race tells us to ""make the city more livable"". It sounds very condescending, like a rich merchant asking the poor peasants to ""hurry up and stop being poor"".

We're trying.

(And when I say ""you"" in this post I mean to point to every NRI that rants about the ""situation in India"" but hasn't contributed to anything significant to help with it.)

> do I miss it? Nah! Do I miss the culture? absolutely yes! Do I want to come back and live there? Nope.

I don't know why I wrote all this. You've said it yourself; you only want the good parts without having to have worked to remove the bad parts.

---

Also, I don't know why you're worried about coming to Hyderabad as a Muslim. I'm not the most politically educated but even I can tell you that Hyderabad is possibly the safest place for an Indian Muslim to live in (particularly a Hyderabadi Muslim). If you don't believe that then either I'm wrong or you've just proven how out-of-touch you are with your culture.  [u/ppcontentrobot](https://www.reddit.com/user/ppcontentrobot/), I wouldn't disagree with anything.

"Economic Shit Storm Incoming brace for impact : What failure of corporate tax rate may imply.  [deleted] Things certainly look shitty but it may be too early to call it a doomsday kind of scenario.  Govt fucked up and have realized their mistakes.  They are too egoistic to admit their mistakes but have reverted back some of their shitty moves.  The corporate tax cut is not going to fix demand issues directly or right away but can help attract some of the investments moving out of China. That can be a huge plus in the years to come.

"The govt takes 1.75 lakh crore from the RBI and proceeds to give 1.45 lakh crore to large corporates.  **The ELI5 version for those who didn't understand OP**:

- Taxes are how government get the money to run itself. 
- When taxes are reduced, government revenue falls. 
- Modi *kaka* has reduced the taxes for his corporate buddies.
- The resulting [tax reduction (of around 27%)](https://www.nationalheraldindia.com/national/corporate-tax-cuts-a-panic-reaction-to-tide-over-choppy-sensex-congress) means government will lose around 1.45 lakh crore in tax revenue.
- Now, remember that the government had forced RBI to give it 1.75 lakh crore to ""boost"" the economy""? 
- So effectively, government tax cut will cause a loss of 1.45 lakh crore, and RBI money will be used to make up for it.
- In effect, Modi *kaka* is using our money so that corporates can get richer and share their wealth with him so that he can continue to dress in style (through 15+ lakh suit boot ~~bribes~~ gifts) and ensure BJP remains the richest political party in India.

**OP's Analysis**:

- OP points out that businesses will just use the money from tax cut to shore up themselves (by buying their own stocks or giving bigger bonuses).
- OP points that the real problem currently is that people are not buying anything.
- Less demands mean business have to reduce production as people are buying less.
- Reducing production means some workers have less or no work to do.
- So businesses will reduce the work force.
- Some businesses will reduce salary of workforce.
- Net effect, there will be less and less money to buy things.
- Reduced demands means more business loss and job cuts.
- OP suggests an income tax rate cut would help with this.
- If people have more money in hand, they will invest and spend more.
- An income tax rate cut is one way to ensure salaried people have more money.

**ELI5 of ""trickle down economy"" concept** under which this big tax cut for corporate is defended:

- The ""trickle down"" economic ""theory"" claims that benefits to the wealthy trickle down to everyone else.
- These benefits are usually tax cuts on businesses, high-income earners, capital gains, and dividends.
- The theory says that only rich people can drive economic growth.
- So it proposes tax cuts only for the wealthy, and not a general tax cut for everyone.
- It also proposes that the cuts have to be big for it to work (based on [Laffer Curve](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/laffercurve.asp) theory).
- It promises that the wealthy will use the extra money from the tax cuts to invest more, and expand business.
- This in turn will create more jobs or better jobs (higher salary).
- Thus, new jobs or higher salary mean people will spend more money and thus boost the economy. 
- This was applied by Reagan and Bush in the USA.
- During both the Reagan and Bush era, the economy improved.
- But Reagan had also increased government spending.
- Bush had also lowered Federal Fund rates (so loans became cheaper).
- So critics do not accept that the ""trickle down"" tax cut theory helped the economy. 
- They point out that during both Reagan and Bush era, inequality between the wealthy and the poor increased.
- The top one-fifth of the rich increased their income by 80%!
- The top 1 percent tripled their income!
- So instead of trickling down, the wealthy just became wealthier. Privatisation of profit and socialisation of loss. Bhai, simple. Chutiya people deserve chutiyi goverment.

Modiji/BJP tatti bhi laake denge toh log kahega wah ye toh Amrit hai. BJP is comparing this to 1991 economic reforms. We live in a time when subsidies and loan waiver to poor is considered ""freebies"" and doling out money to corporates is considered essential for boosting business. The underlying logics are just bizarre! Govt don't understand the meaning of ""Reserve"" in RBI. These (Govt) are the kind of people who would tell you they can't hear you because it's dark outside. Well OP, you don't really understand or have never run a business. See, we have 10 lakh people coming in the cities looking for jobs **every month**. This is from agricultural displacement + new entrants in the workforce.

We fill about \~5% of that.

Now, we are surrounded by countries like Indonesia, Vietnam, Bangladesh, Thailand and Malaysia. Each of them is growing YoY in **manufacturing** exports, women participation in workforce and GDP per capita **faster than India.**

Also, there is a unique situation in world trade where companies are looking to hedge their investments made in China due to a possible breakdown in trade relations with the US and China.

Any company who has to invest anywhere makes an excel sheet to check probable ROIs and compares it with their options. We had \~35% taxes while every single one of these countries had \~20-25%.

OP thinks because there is no demand for consumption, that's why there is a slowdown. **But how does demand arise?** Do you want the government to magically gift people money? People need to work to earn and save money. Money for a poor country like us comes in the form of wages and salaries from manufacturing. **They do not come through subsidies.** That road leads to Venezuela.

This move is not about bUyBAckS or dIViDEnds. They are still taxed (unfairly). **This move is about increasing the base.** 15% tax for new manufacturing units goes a long, long way. It has never been done in India before and it needs to be applauded. We don't even export as many clothes as fucking Bangaldesh. What the fuck are you talking about?

We are not rich. We are poor. We need capital. Lots of it. The **US has zero % capital gains tax for foreign investors.** This after being the largest GDP country in the world. Compare our attitude when Pranab Mukherjee made a retrospective amendment to tax one single company after losing a case in the highest court of the country. Lucid OP is lucid.

I disagree on reducing income tax as being workable in India however. Not enough people pay income tax or are eligible to do so. Doubt a reduction would make any difference since it would affect just a percentage of the middle class at this point. Most people earn below 2.5LPA.

The demand side issue at a larger level is not driven by taxation alone but (probably) low wages, too-many-bills, debt, stagnating rural income.

"The true purpose of reservations in India is not economic upliftment, but social inclusion.  Do you think it is working? What I see is that even otherwise reasonable people get angay and resentful when they talk about reservation. I personally know a few people who talks about sc/st people in extremely bad manner. They weren't like this before entrance examinations after 12th. Now, whenever we discuss about writing PSC examinations, they are like 'Enthina? Kanda polyadikku okke kittum. Nammalu ezhuthiyikk karyamilla' Meaning: For what? Only low caste people(expletive) will benefit from such examinations and we won't get any benefit.

Another thing I have noticed is that these same people are getting more crazy about religion, especially Hindus. They feel that there is no one else to support them. So, reservations don't reinforce already existing caste distinctions in Society? Economic based scholarships would go a long way in alleviating this rather than reservation in jobs.

Once you have education in your mind, you get a certain level of self-awareness and self-respect. > The Scheduled Castes (or SCs) have been treated worse. These communities were classified as social outcasts and were often forced to live outside the village. They weren't allowed to draw water from the same well as the rest of the village, they weren't allowed to visit the temple or take part in the communal activities such as festivals or decision making. They provided an important source of agricultural labour in villages (and still do) and performed menial jobs in the cities that were ritually considered impure or dirty. The agricultural economy would collapse if their labour was not available and sanitation would have been non-existent in the cities without the Dalits to clean the toilets and clear the corpses. And yet, they were not part of the conversation when it came to society. They have never had a voice, a say in the decisions that are made when the community gets together and makes a collective decision. They have been exploited physically, economically, and socially by all and sundry. Their status has been little better than slaves. They are an important part of Indian society but have little to no say in the affairs of the country or the state, and yet they are counted as citizens of India.


Ok, I'm a dalit. I've trying to learn about the history of dalits for a long time. Although what you've written seems like the dominant narrative. I think the truth could be much more sinister. 

In TN, where I live, the Dalit communities in ancient times still lived outside these agricultural societies. But there are several cultural practices, that would turn the idea that dalits were looked down upon. Several rituals in marriages and temple functions etc have a respectable role for members of these castes and receive their blessings. Some temple festivals start with the first ritual being performed from by a member of pariayar community. Then there's that sangam poetry which puts the paraiyar community as one of the noble communities. So there is a lot we are missing here.

But looking at the recent Y-DNA results and the cultural practices of the past. It's possible there was a shift in religious practices that resulted in the dehumanization of dalits. Dalits are most likely the descendants of the tribals that lived in the periphery of the cities. They lived in separate settlements because they are culturally hunter-gatherers. And there definitely was some mixing in the absence of a caste system. And they lived peacefully becacuse the post IVC agricultural societies knew they are descended from hunter-gatherer societies themselves and had hunter-gatherer gods such as Sivan and Murugan. 

The shift is the Sanskritisation of Tamil culture with the arrival of more vedic-leaning brahmins. I think there were other brahmins before who had integrated with Tamil culture and were okay with adopting local traditions. This could be one of the cause for the schisms that exist between iyers and iyengars in TN.  The beginning of the caste system and sanskritization of TN culture would have pushed dalits outside Tamil society in a power struggle for the cultural space of the Tamils with the brahmins winning. Today there are still remnants of this struggle. Lot of old kula deivam temples employ dalits as the priests out of tradition. 

So yea, in the last 1500 years condition of dalits have deteriorated to that of slaves. It just wasn't always like that. I'm a Brahmin too and yes I am not against the reservation but against the efficiency of reservation, my family was extremely poor and my father used to pull rickshaw and worked in a Hotel ( Included cleaning Hotel's toilet about 10 years ago ).

while I've seen abject poverty and with a family of five hardly managing food. In Urban area's most of Upper caste are never different from any other poor, even back in our village the situations have changed with hardly any opportunity  left .There was no government scheme that would help us. That's not just us but most of the relatives back  in the rural area.

Before giving my AIEEE and making it to an NIT, I didn't hardly ate anything for 2 days but water.

I remember my first day of college, where my room mate whose father had association with BAMCEF and grilled me for 15 minutes, as if I was going to discriminate his son. Ultimately he became a good friend despite his father brainwashing him when we parted from the college, to an extent that he admitted and hated the reservation system himself. Through years, he came to know about the fact that poverty strikes both Dalits and Upper caste the same way atleast in Urban areas. Dalits in rural areas no doubt have it worse, and even in Urban areas there is discrimination but it's certainly decreasing. His father was a professor in known college of UP, and he had a relatively cushioned life. Right now there is a generation of Dalits which has reaped benefits of reservation and are not willing to leave the same for the needs of the others.

>Without affirmative action policies such as reservation, these communities will forever be marginalised on the outskirts of society. They will be denied a voice and denied opportunities to advance, and denied the right to be treated with dignity as Humans. The harm done to these communities by centuries of prejudice has hardly begun to be redressed by the policies of Independent India.

Do you think the current reservation system will ever take out these communities from poverty ? there are millions of Dalits in Rural areas who will remain where they are because group of  Elite Dalits of Urban areas will keep reaping the benefits in a cycle.

>The harm done to these communities by centuries of prejudice has hardly begun to be redressed by the policies of Independent India.

If after 70 years of independence, if these efforts have ""hardly"" improved anything then don't you think there is something wrong with the reservation policies ?  By the current pace of improvements in life of Rural Dalits who are real victim, it's going to take 1000's of years. Back in the village a Dalit Family still faces a lot of discrimination, the situation in Urban areas have improved compared to that. The reservation should preferably be given Rural Dalits and then anyone else. I don't understand your blanket statement, a lot of communities within Dalits are now very rich and powerful, if we don't change the system this will be just another caste system.

>Reservation is not about economic opportunity. It is about social justice, and economic opportunity is a by product of social opportunity. Until such a time arrives when these communities are afforded the same social opportunities as the rest of society and are not excluded

I lost my mother to Cancer 6 years ago, a lot of poor people do. We didn't had money to get her treated in a good hospital. Certainly again government won't help us under NHP schemes the budget were allocated for SC/ST. Some of them being not utilised. We wrote to countless bureaucratic structure to help us, so that we could use the same under as we were economically poor but we couldn't. She died in extreme sufferings. Is this the social justice that you are talking about ?Reservation system in India is deeply flawed and it's time we start talking about it.

You write very nice things, but I don't think you've seen the poverty as a upper class poor or even Dalit for that matter. Ask them and they would any day leave their caste / creed / religion and be whatever you ask them to be. /u/conqueror_of_destiny While I agree with most of your text, the aim of affirmative action is not social equality(inclusion) but equal representation. AA does not aim to remove discrimination, but to provide representation to those who have been historically oppressed.

Anti-discrimination laws exist to ensure social equality, while social schemes exist for economic equality. Paisa hai to status hai bhai. Agar paisa hai to untouchable also becomes a valued best friend you brag about Yeah. It's sad and funny that a lot of people nowadays think the main problem with caste system is reservation and the small minority that ""abuses"" it. i agree to you. but none of these reason justifies reservation to person who belongs to family of a civil servant, doctor, rich bushiness man, (economically strong) families. \>Until such a time arrives when these communities are afforded the same social opportunities as the rest of society and are not excluded, reservations are a necessity in India.

&#x200B;

1. How do you measure social opportunity?
2. Do you believe OBC reservations  are a evil\\necessary evil or are they justice?
3. Why do you believe ""justice"" against those not guilty of discrimination is not evil? 
4. What social opportunities are available to a lower middle class Jat\\Kshatriya that are not available to a Sr level SC govt employees kid and how does an IIT reserved seat help the kid get those? Correct me if I’m wrong. But wasn’t the original purpose of reservation to uplift minorities in a certain amount of years and then remove it when equality( economically and socially) for all people is reached but then every politician decided to just use it for votes instead of actually uplifting the minorities. Truth is their are not much gov jobs compared to increasing population of India. Reservation in job doesn’t matter much.

secondly talking about merit based admission in colleges their are not much good quality of institute apart from IIMs and IITs and few other.  and IITs are also not that extraordinary. so pro-reservation lobby must understand that all students from sc/st/obc generally are less talented than 50% of the class. and it is very likely they will remain below avrg in their Batch. only top 5% or 10% are winners at the end of 3/4 years degree. 
and people against reservation complaining sc/st/obc stealing their seats they need to under that even reservation is removed u won’t amount much. 

I see whole reservation thing as dividing India more than actually helping SC/ST/OBC.  
their was a reason ambedkar did not want reservation forever.

This is a very good initiative and deserves appreciation. 

Some suggestion:

- The current format brings attention but is not suitable to stimulate a discussion because of the wide variety of topics listed. Reddit works because each thread is about one topic (roughly put), and it attracts those who are interested in discussing that particular subject. 

- Instead of collecting everything in one single thread, I'd rather that the mods split them by topics into separate threads. 

- Personally, I feel the ""community policing"" model of reddit in general is failing because of vote manipulation by vested interests. (This initiative is a good example for this). 

- As such, I feel the mods here should be bolder - don't just help with the policing of the community but be more active contributors by becoming editors (or nominate or elect members from the community to be ""editors"").

- The task of of the ""editor"" should be as it is in any modern publication or media outlet - sift though the 100's or thousands of moderated content submitted everyday and highlight content that the r/india community should be more aware of, discuss and debate. 

- For this, the mods shouldn't be afraid to have more than 2 sticky threads on the front page. (In fact, personally I'd be comfortable with up to 5-6 stickies every day.)

- Thus stickies by community ""editors"" and the generally community contributed upvoted / debated content on the front page should make things more interesting here and also help more in creating harder to manipulate community with better content.

Whether or not he was, I fail to understand how that is connected to the statement Dr. MMS had made on the economy.

To me, this is the single biggest blunder The DeMo was big but one time blunder. Whereas, ignoring the farm crisis year on year is an even bigger blunder. You cannot say we have managed inflation by putting more than 50% of the population in severe debt and income crisis. That's not how you manage inflation. And that's exactly why this BJP govt has got the basics of economics wrong. And even now, I am afraid that all the subsidies are going to go to industries. Sure you can artificially increase the production and trade through govt intervention. But only for a limited period of time. Because who would consume what is produced when 50% of the population have had very poor income and are in debt. I really really hope that govt invests into the rural market.

Useful to share when someone says ""oh it's cyclical, the global economy is slowing down"", etc.

MMS says it's a man-made disaster and I agree... maybe the UPA wasn't perfect and benefited from lucky market cycles (like the pre-2010 real estate boom), but all we've had since 2014 is pointless marketing campaigns with no follow-through like 'Make in india', 'startup india', etc, then self-inflicted wounds like Demonetisation, hastily-implemented GST, and all sorts of random regulations and taxes, including extreme margins for the govt on fuel (and businesspeople reporting increased harassment.) This is a misery. However, I salute Modi Govt. to have steered Indians and kept them away from realising these problems by giving them some other bullshit motives to praise him... like a Hindu rashtra and ordering some airstrike. He totally distracted people and still has them distracted from growing problems of unemployment..which was already the most serious problem during his 1st term.

You have to admit, NaMo is an expert at marketing himself and still keeping himself in power using things against the people of India which they like the most. Even among these problems of lack of employment, the people of India too (maybe not those who come here on Reddit, but still a lot of them) prefer  achieving a hindu rashtra rather than bringing something home to feed their families. It's not just NaMo, it's also the people of India. NaMo is just using this gullible nature to his advantage. 

And his propoganda...ooh la la...mamma mia....xD...all this fooling around with Rahul Gandhi being an idiot..well...to be fair...both leaders have said terribly stupid things in the past...but nobody ridicules the NaMo but pounces on RaGa instantaneously. Like seriously..you think we don't notice that there is no connection in totally ripping apart RaGa's political image apart and nobody touching you. Wow! 

This brings me to that airstrike...there was some terrorist activity and whatever action was needed to be taken was taken. Would've been done regardless of who was in power. And anyway, the suggestion to conduct an airstrike would've been suggested by the Head of the IAF, CAS; PMO just gives a GO to any suggestion. It was obviously beneficial to him looking how overtly patriotic our idiotic citizens were becoming. Another cheap thrill Indians love: Insulting Pakistan in whatever way possible. As a result...Indians loved this activity and there goes NaMo again.

And as a matter of fact...he steers the crowd so well, that these very people who had a twinkle in their eyes at the thought of 'acche din' have forgotten that those 'acche din' never arrived. So fucking awesome that a leader can do this. Last I knew somebody being this influential was Adolf Hitler and this is not insulting Modi. Maybe Forbes also named him one of the top most influential leaders of the world....but they don't know what kind of influence. 

You should try triggering people sentimentally by saying something mildly anti Modi on a primitive social platform like Facebook or Whatsapp...(some platform where a majority of this hindu-rashtra loving population is). The kind of blind love for NaMo and the immediate labelling of anti-national, endless hate, life threats, rape threats and whatnot: This is where you see the true India..the India that voted BJP in power.

In such a scenario, where the government and the citizens focus more on religion than actual livelihood of themselves, the people who want a better life are just stuck here. Best solution according to me is to escape this country ASAP and settle at place where your livelihood is not affected and you're away from religious wars and petty politics. Places like this exist, trust me. You just cannot thrive in India and cultivate a good ambitious career here. 

Maybe there will come a time where India will plunge so deep down this shithole that it'll have to press a hard reset over everything and start afresh. Maybe some day then it'll have a better and educated leader who'll actually take the reigns of this actually glorious country and restore it. Maybe maybe maybe. But this plunging and this reset is far from near....not happening 1-2  generations away from me since the current and all future contingents for this leadership are fucked up people. It'll take some more years to bring this country down just by virtue of it's volume. Since it is so slow, nobody is noticing... that's it.

This may be sounding a bit anti-nationalistic but I really think this is where the country is leading and there's no way leaders are mending their ways in the near future to steer away from this mess...they only know how to steer away from reality. Am I the only one who read it in his voice?

Farmers may be distressed now. The middle class may be bearing the brunt of Modinomics now. SMEs may be feeling the pinch now.

People elected the current government in the hopes of stronger economy and much, much needed job creation. They seriously need to get their act together and focus on things that matter.

"[Rant] Criminalization of CSR is another pain for companies  I always feel CSR is unethical. Companies are paying tax and that is their social responsibilty and that is it. Now another 2% and than making it compulsory is just wrong. It like tax not paid to government over the tax paid directly to govt. Btw i am happy that you own a 500cr turnover company. [removed] This govt is making a big F mess of our economy... Also note that the government often leans on companies to provide funding for statues and other nonsense. I would just put a blanket provision in place saying all CSR funds go towards local government schools proportioned by number of employees of that company in a given location. You are correct. Companies should just be nationalized so that 100% of the work goes towards the community instead of the tiny % that goes towards CSR. All the points you stated about employment, wealth creation in the community, etc. will still be true and nobody will have to deal with such regulatory burdens. To be fair, the 'criminalisation' you refer to has always been there ever since it was introduced. CSR's non-compliance has always had (one of the) penalty as imprisonment. They haven't really changed the penal provisions with the amendment, just the enforcement strictness. From all practical perspective, (till now) non-compliance usually leads to compounding (basically a fine) and very very rarely leads to imprisonment (at least I'm not aware of any). I think from an enforcement perspective, they want to tighten things and make sure the companies are not just 'clicking pictures' and doing the CSR but are actually doing the work (or getting it done).

But you're right, the compliance officer might not be on the same page with respect to the CSR activities which can be troublesome to explain and (to show that he's doing his job and being strict n all), it may lead to unnecessary procedures and countless explanations. But then again, that's the thing with any compliance that is done in India. The finance minister is from JNU....................... Hello fellow 500 cr company stakeholder! Forcing companies to do CSR is good. The existence of the companies is net negative interms of benefit to society. If companies do CSR they interact direcly with society and understand some of the negative aspects of their existence and behavior.",Policy/Economy
"[Rant] India’s BRUTAL tax for the rich  At what level of income does 42% tax come in? So apparently there are only 5000 such people with such high income and so the impact on the country is marginal. This exactly is why this form of taxation is bullshit. There are way more than 5000 people earning 2 crore and above in India.

All the rest not only evade taxes, they also are contributing to the black economy beause they will be penalized otherwise. If India has to mop up tax revenue, we need to stop treating rich people as criminals and make it easier for them to consume more. And tax that consumption. I, for one, am for higher taxation for the super-rich. But where I am in total agreement with you is what the money is being used for. If it was for developing the nation and social welfare schemes I am all for it, but right now it just lines the pockets of politicians and gives out doles to the vote banks. This sucks. I don't want to pay taxes to make someone else rich or to help someone be in power.

If you want to move abroad, most (developed) countries have a higher rate of taxation than us. But of course, in most of those cases the taxes are put in to better use.

[This wikipedia list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_tax_rates) compares taxation rates between countries, and you'll see most European countries have a very high tax rate. It can go upto 60% in Scandinavian countries, but then again, in those countries you don't have to pay for education or healthcare. In US, the highest tax rate is 50.5% and in Canada 54% (in Nova Scotia). Even Nepal has a 50% income tax for the super-rich! BTW, I'm curious why you dont buy a US green card though? Under EB5, I think they require 3-4 crore invested and even if invested via brokers and so on I've heard you get most of it back after 5 years... You, my friend, may be an exception. I agree with your points. The quality of life is atrocious - high pollution levels , increasing crime , shabby infrastructure and subsidies for everyone apart from the honest tax payers ( white income ). 

If you have the means look at US or Canada and get an OCI card. I know a lot of people who took EB5 visa to US and escaped the drudgery of life in India. If you belong to a super rich community, you should be Getting TFO of the country. Which is what thousands of French  millionaires did when France passed a ridiculous wealth tax law.

you can't fight an economically illiterate government, which is rewarded by the electorate with crushing margins of victory despite its economically insane policies. (see demonetization).  Expect this pattern (crazy economic policies, military adventures to whip up 'patriotism', religious rabble rousing etc)  to repeat when the next elections come around in 2024.

  If I were you, I'd be long gone to a country where  at the *least* those kinds of high taxes would at least get me something in return.

PS: If you are really super rich (and not trolling us) , and don't plan to leave, maybe you can help some fellow randians GTFO? Thanks in advance ;-) why are you living in india? Cattle class here and i completely agree with you. The budget was a total disappointment. A majority govt is of no use if it cannot take difficult steps. 

India need to grow faster and we need rich hardworking smart people to do that. 

Farmers are glorified, the subsidies are the reason why loss making farms continue to work, there is no consolidation of farm lands even after 70 years, consolidated farmlands are necessary for large scale mechanisation and higher productivity level in agriculture.

Consolidation of farmland will provide necessary cheap labor at factories which will attract foreign capital. Till the time foreign investments arrive govt should utilise this cheap labor for large infrastructure projects.

But fuck it all, loot the rich hardworking class and feed the poor. There is no point saying such reasonable things in India. People here want even moderately successful people to be double and triple taxed on the same income and support giving freebies to farmers, even if it means our public discoms go into debt and can’t distribute electricity efficiently, or urban citizens suffer from a drought because 80% of a reservoir’s water has been diverted to appease rich farmers who lobby the government. 

People even on this thread are calling for even more welfare spending, without even realizing that the cumulative effect of welfare spending every year is the reason we have less to invest in infrastructure than East Asian nations. 

The government will laugh at you, swindle you, demean your education and achievements and harrass you or libel you to gain votes, and then cozy up to you if you’re successful. 70+ years after independence and our financial capital floods every year, illiteracy is still high, the trains are miserable compared to those in Europe, flat, even roads are a rarity and corruption is still sky-high. 

There are encouraging signs, but God this country takes great effort to make sure everyone everywhere is miserable. Our tax is marginal tax. That means entire income isn't taxed at 30% only the value which goes above the slab.",Policy/Economy
"[AskRandia] has anyone quit their job without any plan? I just want to travel, read and write. Now sure how to make money. [Rant]? Please read inside.  Well you sound like you desperately need a vacation to get your head sorted. Try to take 2 weeks off before quitting to come up with atleast a small plan to see what you want to do? That’s the only suggestion that I can give. So, I'll tell you how it all works out. 
I am no MBA neither am I some IIT. But I quit my decent paying job, moved back home first and eventually phased out of my job.

I just get about 10k coz in my free time I help dad manage some shit.

I was actively working on starting something of my own been about 40 months and nothing has yet worked out. I read a lot but that too has fizzled out coz now I am bored of books or frustrated in general and now I am more focused to getting back to earning.

I want to travel but that hasn't worked great 10k a month is insufficient for the entire month. 
So I went for a trek to Utharakhand. I paid 4500 in flight tickets to Delhi, train was about 900 I guess and 3500 for the trip. Stay was with friends and food was taken care. So saved there.

I planned a Hampi trip, it's supposed to be a cheap vacation from the place I live. But then j have other important expenses, like my health Insurance. I didn't have it until last year and then I got admitted into a hospital for 3 days and ended up paying more than a lakh.

My mom's root canal cost me 12k, You'll have to ensure your teeth are proper. Those buggers are a money sink.

You getting the idea?

Assuming you living in your home town. Now let's see you'll have friends and they'll surely want you to chill with them, they will be earning - once in a while you will have to go out with them, obviously don't want to end up alone coz you pinch money. One outing will set you back about 2k if you drink in my city. 

These are expenses and lifestyle you don't imagine and I considered it easy.

Do not. You have expenses, you have bills. You need a good passive income to sail you through. 
Again it'll be a call you'll have to take, lifestyle same rakhna hai ya scale down karna hai. 

For a similar lifestyle - I need about 15k a month to survive. But this is no savings. This is bills, travel and basic comfort.

Oh ya, your parents are getting old, so those expenses are something you need to keep in mind too. Even if they have saved some for themselves, as an Indian I am assuming, you'll be there and take responsibility.

What's the trade you need to make and how far can you go with a discipline? > DAE want to not work in a soul sucking job and just chill out and do things you enjoy?

That's what 90% of humanity dreams of bro Don't quit without a plan.

The least you can do is calculate how far your savings will last you, should you quit. After that, make a detailed plan on how to stretch your savings. Finally, as someone else commented, try picking up some freelance work on the internet or IRL to set up a network/fallback. If you can't find freelance work, it probably means you'll have to live solely on your savings...

Oh, and be absolutely sure that you can land a job again after a sabbatical - most industries choose to hire young 'uns because they are cheap and abundant. So, pretty soon you might find yourself too old or too expensive or both. You may not want to go back to a job but if things don't go right, you might just need to, so make sure that avenue remains open.

Source: Currently on a sabbatical. This is how I did it. I did it out of the blue in 2006. I just wanted to do my own thing. Had no idea what to do. Job is not something you are supposed to enjoy. That's why you get paid for doing it. If it was something you enjoyed, you would be paying to do it. You do your job from Monday to Friday, make money & then use that money to pursue your hobbies (read/write/travel) during weekends, holidays and vacations. 

There is a lot of stuff between like & hate. So try to get a job you don't hate (you don't necessarily need to love it) & use the money to pursue your hobbies. You should generate some passive income, start an online business. Selling products on Amazon. If you can do an investment of 50k and buy products from Suppliers, like Alibaba, etc, you might generate a passive income. You can do a research on that topic. Options are unlimited you just have to find them. Travelling takes toll on one's body also it isn't as galmours or enjoyable as people make it seems. A man without a plan won't survive much would not recommend. I was in your place a few years ago. A little older, lesser LPA, more in bank. Headed north and stayed with a friend, planned to head further north to volunteer. Friend convinced me that was not what I wanted, plus had an epiphany over more rounds of beers than usual. Dropped the plan, got back in the grind, realized it is not time to give up just yet.

If the anecdote avove doesn't help, get and read the book Vagabonding by Rolf Potts. While I would've loved a life on the road, that life without purpose would have bored the fuck out of me in months, in not years. God, things would have been different, worlds apart even, but I'm happy and content now. To be frank, almost everyone hates their job and want to leave it and instead travel and enjoy their life, but only a few are able to do so due to various factors. 

I agree with the top comment. First take two weeks leave and then plan how you want to do it. 

For the money part, how much have you saved till now? Do you have any loans? Better invest your savings in 1)Gilt funds and 2) Overnight funds to get better returns than FD and Savings account respectively. As most people have suggested, take a shorter break and figure out what you’d like to do. Quitting before figuring out may backfire and you might end up in a worse place. 

What if you don’t like traveling after a few months? What if you don’t like psychology a few months after you start your education ? I’d suggest taking time off and volunteering/ shadowing or working part time in a field you like and testing the waters before making the leap. 

Also it might just be that you need to switch jobs in your industry and choose something more laid back, rather make a drastic change. Remember the grass always seems greener on the other side. Just take smaller steps to figure out things. Good luck.",AskIndia

A few tips from my side:

1) It'd be really awesome if you had a subreddit, cuz Facebook can become really Obnoxious, what with all the meme pages, and all the hundreds of friends that people can have. Atleast with a subreddit, Moderation is much more strict, there's pinned posting allowed, and well, there's a lot more control in general.

2) Are there plans to set up a fort location, i:e One location/constituency, that you'd prefer to start with, and focus on first? Cuz I think if you'd start with one, you might slowly reach state-level, which is more than enough to get the nation's attention. I like your long term approach. Anything is possible with tenacity and will power. Good luck to you. The trouble with your plan is that it will strike the vast majority of Indians as being culturally inauthentic. The idea as presented simply is not Indian. It is just an artificial and weird mish-mash of a lot of things that seem to look good at this stage in history (2019), but it doesn't have deep roots in the soul and soil of the land.

BJP is successful because they have a vision for India that (as per their narrative) is as ancient as our earliest recollections of India itself. This vision is made of songs and stories and Gods and saints that are deeply embedded in a lot of Indians' consciousness and their understanding of who we are. They can cite ancient scriptures as sources of the values they advocate. Their imagery and rhetoric have deep roots in the nation's history. Take the icon of mother India or Bharat Mata. Some say that this idea is just a copy of the corresponding European ideas, but every Hindu sees Bharat Mata as just another instance of Shakti, the mother goddess, which is an idea that has deep roots in the Hindu psyche nourished by a vast fund of religious literature and practices.

What RSS achieved over 50 years is only possible if you believe strongly in one ideology. Religion and their rules are a tool to make people cooperate on a large scale, without which they will not. 

I feel it's impossible to create organized movements in that kind of way anymore, unless you use a strong ideology to unite people. But if you do that, it will create blind faith and extremism and that will be counter your original purpose. Moreover, it will counter act against one of the most important qualities that people need in India - Individualism. 

Look at the best countries across the world, they don't have any popular organized groups throughout the country. The Vegan community is the closest comparision I can think of in those countries and even vegans are famous for being intolerant, adhering to their strictly enforced guidelines within the community. As soon as you place the identitiy of a community or a group above an individual, it will lead to the same result. The devloped countries and their institutions are succesful because the majority doesnt beleive in any single ideology strongly, all of them value individual thoughts so it becomes impossible to compromise everything, all at once. 

Therefore, I don't think you should try to replicate their success. But I also don't know a solution to how it can be possible to impart these important values without making under a banner. I really like this idea, and to be honest I was thinking of something like this myself. I'd really like to join, or at the very least contribute to discussions and present ideas and solutions.
 In addition, somebody mentioned here that the ideology might not appeal to Indians the same way that hindutva does and I believe their statement holds a lot of truth. AAP is an example, so it should be a priority to figure out how to strongly appeal to the masses. 

Overall, I want to thank you for being the change you want to see and for actually doing something lol. Please make a sub, not everyone of us are in FB.

yes. Even in the days where Jio is like the king of data, I still like to use BSNL. Not because it charges high, or something like that. But to help it survive.

BSNL still has one of the widest coverage, in areas nobody else could operate profitably. This comes at a high cost but the value provided is also high, not in monetary terms but in connectivity to remote areas.  From now on, when someone says Private Companies, they mean one/many of {reliance of big bro, reliance of small bro, adani, or some gujarati fraud company}  also, they were sabotaged by staff unions to avoid disinvestment. only profit-making companies shall be IPO'ed .  They won't let it die and they won't let it live. Doesnt matter what you see it as. It is a for profit entity listed on exchanges and must follow the law as any entity. Giving preference to BSNL would be unfair to other private companies. It would discourage foreign investments in all sectors if this is the attitude displayed by the govt. Worse even existing foreign players would drag India to dispute in WTO.

Not just that, this type of behavior is detrimental for the transfer of knowledge and job creation. I remember the days when BSNL was so damn expensive. Glad we opened up to private sector and now the calls and data both are dirt cheap. Third, also a big PSU like BSNL is a hotpot for corruption. Private companies do the job just as efficiently and fairly. Yes, they have no incentive to expand to remote areas, but this is also industry that changes very rapidly from 2G, 3G, to 4G to now 5G. There needs to be a constant stream of investments, infrastructure upgradations, and network managment - All of which is probably not efficiently possible for a PSU.

Also private players succeed well because they have better boards, leadership teams, promoters with deep pockets playing the long game. They are faster to change and more adaptive to changing customer behaviors.

Your argument that BSNL is an utility and it makes sense to keep it running, and yes I do agree with that. However, this should be done by infusing more money by govt, not by twisting rules to work in its favor. But, where is the govt gonna get the money from? Also, India is a developing country and there is much better ROI by using that money for infrastructure / job growth rather than subsidizing a bloated / inefficient PSU.  Bsnl will make a comeback, I think so.  Red tapesim, favouring privatisation, crippling BSNL etc etc...",Business/Finance

"Help the TRAI set its digital priorities for 2019  1. **Simplify recharge plans**

My ideal interaction with provider would be to throw annual payment their way and forget they exist for a year.

I'd really like simple pay-and-forget-for-a-long-time plans. Mainly to receive calls and occasionally make them.

Data is totally *unimportant* to me. I'm ready to pay for such an annual subscription, but they come up with all these complicated recharge plans where there are all kinds of voice+data tradeoffs, and weird validity restrictions. They are complicating decision making for no benefit to me. It's even more complicated for people like my parents who are unable to remember things like these. It's like aadhar all over again.

Simply put, I'd like them to offer simple idiotproof plans for idiots like me and my family. Take our money, and give us voice calls and SMSes for a year.

&#x200B;

2. **Handling 2G/3G retirement**

Recently, in August, I had a very bad experience with my provider.

I got an SMS out of the blue from provider on a Sunday afternoon - a day when their own customer offices are closed - that I *have* to get my SIM changed from a 2G to 4G compatible one by next morning 9AM.

The next morning they just shut off my service, just like that!

I had to disrupt my work plans to facilitate *their* stupid administrative work, surrender my aadhar details to them to get their new SIM, faced problems with fingerprint biometrics (4 fingers didn't match, luckily my middle finger did. Yes, they asked for my middle finger and I gave them my middle finger, literally and figuratively), and then, worst of all, they took 48 hours to activate SMSes or calls on that new SIM - apparently, that's some kind of security feature to prevent phishing.

My mobile is my emergency as well as business device. 2 days offline as their official planned migration procedure with little advance warnings was not a good feeling, and was very customer hostile.

&#x200B;

Now there's news that they plan to forcefully retire 2G and 3G altogether in the next year or so, and allow only 4G capable mobiles. I have no doubt they'll botch up that too.

I'd like TRAI to review their decisions about this forceful retirement. If it's absolutely necessary, then I'd like TRAI to make provider come up with a properly planned procedure with minimum disruption and advance warning to customers . 1 hour I can understand, but 2 days forced offline is ridiculous.

&#x200B;

Edit: 1 more point

**3. Emergency addressal of service issues**

Thanks to the government's own policies which require mobile service for everything from OTPs for aadhar to banking, a mobile cannot be treated like any another service. Things like mobile number phishing or service stoppage can result in grave personal / financial consequences to a user. It can't be left to customers to coordinate between private company customer service and police, who all follow their own adhoc timelines. It requires some kind of neutral ombudsman who can address issues in emergencies and have jurisdiction to direct actions at the telco operator level if required. Any compensation issues can be addressed later, just like it happens in healthcare emergencies.

&#x200B; A month = 28 days? BSNL is doing random ad injection and page redirection. I have noscript browser extension installed on firefox. From time to time sites I visit get content from BSNL IP addresses. Multiple posts have been made on r/india about complaining to local bsnl offices, but I guess these kind of decisions to redirect traffic are made way up the mgmt food chain that local frontline BSNL managers cant do anything about.

If BSNL is allowed to do it, whats preventing Reliance Jio from redirecting any commercial request to their businesses? Unnecessary spam in form of ads, calls, messages as well as emails by jio. I recharge my plan I know what plan I'm taking I don't need 3 calls, 5 messages and even more emails to tell me what it is for. Plus the imminent spam of everything that begins just a week prior to expiry of the plan. I'm bombarded with calls, sms, emails and worst of all, the myjio app inserting full page banner ads everywhere in the system as they please, telling me to recharge. I block a number and I get call from another number, but never again from same one(I've set to notify if blocked number calls), this is even more fishy, how do you know I blocked your number? And biggest of all, how many numbers do you have to just spam your customers? This needs to be regulated strictly as well. 1. A plan should not be called unlimited if there is FUP
2. Do away with 28-day plans. Plans less than 30 days should be allowed to exist only if a similar 30-day option is given. 28 days = 13 billing cycles per year and we're not stupid. 
3. Content Blocking: Ideally there should be no content blocking. But if there has to be, then TRAI or the DoT should maintain a public database of hosts/ips/URLs that are blocked. 
4. Pay-and forget unlimited plans - take my money and make yourself scarce. There should be simple annual unlimited voice, SMS, and data plans where one can just pay annually and not think about it again. 
5. Regulate logging by ISPs
6. DNS over TLS service must be provided as an option to all subscribers.
7. Fast track escalation/resolution of DND violation complaints. Stricter action against telemarketers who violate people's DND preferences.  With respect to Broadband. Trai in **2006** had set *guidelines*for internet speeds. The ISP had to guarantee **80%** of the speed till the last node.

This was back in copper wire dial up days.

Now with fiber optics, the tolerance could be reduced. Say 95% of the speed guaranteed.

Also traffic shaping should be stopped or made public before buying a connection.

Fair usage policy should be done away with, unlimited plans should be truly unlimited. Given now there's Fiber to home connection, we are no longer *taking away others network* which was the original argument for FUP. Corporations who buy bulk phone numbers to sell stuff... Please regulate that.

&#x200B;

While buying something from a store where they ask for my phone number, I would really prefer my phone number not being sold to any other company.

I end up receiving calls from companies trying to sell me properties in my city, insurance, and all other crap.

PLEASE MAKE MORE STRICT RULES FOR CORPORATIONS TO COLLECT MOBILE NUMBER. What we really do need is more information from our ISPs. A lot of ISPs ,especially in smaller towns, throttle internet speeds at varying times in the day to save their own costs, go below the plan that they have given out and people generally don't complain because they've sort of grown up knowing ""Internet band ho gaya""

I don't have a solution. Perhaps better auditing of ISPs in smaller towns would help this. We don't have fiber or good internet and the local ISPs can basically take full advantage of that 30,61,92,185,366 days plans.  

No requirement of having to recharge the number compulsorily. 

Plans for only voice.

Plans for only data. And volte. 

Stop using SMS for ads.  I don't think anyone reads them. It's just nuisance. Easy options to review and report violations of DND. And punishments for those sub selling their databases for SMS dumps.

"Questions for supporters of the current Government in India  Yesterday I was watching election coverage in MP and Rajasthan. And almost all small businessmen said they used to support BJP but GST and Notebandi has ruined their business. Though BJP bhakts are still high on demonetization claiming it eliminated black money. So asking them questions expecting rational and practical answer is unfair to their intelligence.  You missed the real treason committed by not only Modi but every single BJP MPs sitting in parliament that day. This particular instance was the day I concluded that BJP is worse than even ISIS. These retarded shameless fucks sold out our entire nation, everything we fought for; our independence and sovereignty of India in the future , all ruined by these brainless retards BJP and RSS.

They legalised corruption and foreign interference in Indian politics by letting foreign powers(even foreign government by a shell company and private companies, remember east India company?) fund Indian political parties and elections. They later also made these donations anonymous, so that its never revealed who funded our government. And all this was passed illegally as a money bill along with many other bills sticked together. Check the FCRA amendment and all the other related bills.

This taking foreign funds to change or affect the outcome of our Indian election is the very definition of Treason. There is no bigger treason that you betraying your country by taking money from foreigners to represent them in the PARLIAMENT OF INDIA and betraying the PEOPLE OF INDIA. ANd the traitor party made this legal and anonymous so that no one will know. Are you a teenager? If not, by now you should have realized that Indians accept a baseline level of lies and dishonesty from all governments and all parties. 

It does not matter that these people are liars and dishonest, but at least they are our liars (belong to our tribe, cast, etc). Got it now? Oooo.. logic and everything is being used here.

Every Indian who is true to his salt should raise his / her voice against them. >You have nothing to fear from anyone, especially the Muslims. In fact they live in mortal fear even though they belong to this country and love it, love it probably more than you do.

This. Not just Muslims but Christians and other religion as well, not that many religions except for those two. Remember how churches were being attacked too for no reason in 2014. 

Just before Rajasthan polls now, Aaj Tak is claiming there is gonna be a Terrorist attack by muslim groups in rallies of you know who. This is the standard tactic of BJP to polarize the voters just days before Modi's rallies and the voting day. And shamefully mainstream media spreads this without consulting Investigating agencies. This is the shit game they are playing which seems to be working out for them right now. 

But it's a design they have created even before Independence if India, which they have successfully done it with years of creating enough poison and hate.

You wouldn't hear that from any Muslims and Christians in rallies and speeches, they don't make one except for that Owaisi who works for Modi as an scripted enemy.

>At this point though, India is large enough an economy that it starts taking over the mantle \>from China about Asian leadership. And genuinely rises in influence and power to be called a \>superpower. Do you see that happening? And which factors will actually hasten this process?

Most of India are still gonna be mired in poverty. Same situation as Africa and Indonesia right now. Ask yourself if the outside world have given them any respect despite growing their economic size without condoms or birth control? OK, maybe Indonesia have done more than Africa and India at this issue but my main gist of my argument still stands. The world only respects countries with either Oil, Strong Military, Huge Economy, Good Education, Advanced Technology and Infrastructure. China is leading or catching up quickly to the West and other first world countries in many of those aspects.

>Some dramatic changes in policy? Takeover from an authoritarian regime \(some would argue we're \>in one right now\)?

Maybe but it's gonna be very bloody. Unlike your average East Asians\(Chinese/Japanese/Vietnamese/Koreans\) who tend to be very meek and subservient, South Asians generally wouldn't have a stand for it and will most likely ignite a civil war leading to the eventual fall of South Asia. The first question is why India wants to be a super power. Will it matter when we became super power still have poverty and unjust society?

"I wanna follow football,where do i start?  You want to follow football just to blend in at social events?


Anyway, I'd suggest you to stwrt watching EPL (English Premier League) matches (Weekends mostly, on Hotstar or Star sports). It's the most followed league. So, you can google the fixture timungs of top 4-5 teams in the league. 


You'll learn about the rules slowly by yourself as you gather more interest in the sport. Also, follow r/soccer for updates on International football. 


We've got ISL on national level too. You can follow r/Indianfootball for updates on that. Just start watching games and play as often as you can. There's nothing like the thrill of being involved in a nice passing move like the one you saw in the match on the weekend.  
  
Good/exciting teams to watch in the English Premier League (EPL) at the moment: Liverpool, Man City, Leicester City.  
  
I myself am an Arsenal fan and I invite you to join me in supporting the club if you're masochist who doesn't have enough pain and disappointment in your life.  
  
As for other leagues, I don't know much. Perhaps others can help you. As far as I can tell, pretty much all EPL games are broadcast in India. Most La Liga (Spain) and Bundesliga (Germany) games are broadcast. Serie A (Italy) and Ligue Un (France) are harder to follow.  
  
I suggest you don't pick a team to watch at first. Just watch whatever football you can. But my honest suggestion is to not feel pressured into supporting ""local"". Your time is precious. Football, playing or watching, is supposed to be recreational and enjoyable. Watching 22 guys kick and rush and plod around a grass rectangle can be difficult to really get into. But if you watch high quality football, there's nothing like it.  
  
The channel Tifo Football on YouTube has some really nice videos on history, tactics, and current news in football. Maybe others can mention more YT channels that put out good content. 
  
If you're a reader, I can't recommend anything more highly than the book Inverting the Pyramid by Jonathan Wilson. It's a beautiful book that will introduce you to the history of the game, the quaint developments along the way, and some of the most fascinating and inspiring characters in the sport. I was already bitten by the bug before I read the book but reading it only intensified my love for the game and put me into a phase of obsessing over it.  
  
**Most importantly, I suggest you should not feel obliged to follow football because everyone around you is talking about it. I don't want to assume too much but the way your post is worded makes me think everyone around you mainly talks about football and you have nothing to contribute. If that's what they're doing then don't be hesitant about breaking it up and talking about something else which is of common interest. I've been that asshole who used to talk only football and had nothing to say about anything else. It's shit and I would have been grateful for friends who were willing to talk about other stuff.**  
  
If football doesn't catch your fancy, you don't need to watch it. It's a wonderful sport and I hope my suggestions are of help in getting you to love it the way I do but really, it's not the be all and end all. Most football bros eventually grow out of talking about it 24/7. Do what you like. Cultivate your own interests and introduce others to them like I'm trying to introduce to football. I'm sure they'll be grateful. [deleted]",AskIndia
"17 y/o girl, wants to be a chef, parents stereotyping. [advice]  How much are you willing to sacrifice to achieve your goal? Is your goal worth those sacrifice? You have a lot of soul searching to do here. If you let your parents control the very aspect of your life that you have to live with all your life then you will resent the hell out of them when you have a failure in your academic life or eventual career, which, believe you me, everyone does. 

I'll give you two examples here, both are of my friends and you can take from it whatever you like. My friend named Ashish comes from a Marwari family and his father is a sales consultant. When he was 17, he was adamant that he wanted to do hospitality management like his cousin, who was pursuing it in London and not become a CA like his father wanted him to be. He eventually gave into his father's wishes and pursued being a CA. It took him 7 years to become a CA but he eventually became one and now has his own practice. He earns decent money now, married but resents his father to this day.

The second guy, Nikunj, brilliant in studies, just like you, and wanted to pursue commerce to become a banker but his parents insisted he do engineering since he scored to high a percentage in his boards to 'waste' it by doing a commerce course. He never completed his engineering and resented his parents for it. He eventually got into actuarial science and flourished; eventually his relationship with his parents improved too. 

Take what you may of these examples but imho you do what you love to do in life. Money will follow you no matter what. If you love what you do and are good at what you do the money will come to you no matter what.

P.S : Your parents expecting you to cook for your husband everyday is beyond shameful. I hope you don't feel obligated to be the typical subservient woman that is expected in an Indian household after your marriage, if you choose to marry. This patriarchal shit needs to end. [deleted] [deleted] Two questions, how far are you willing to go? and how far will your parents go? 

The choice you are going to make is a difficult one. Whatever choice you make, it is going to define your near future (or maybe even far), for better or for worse. Talk to your parents about this. It is not only just what you say, but also how you say it matters. They shouldn't think that you making a decision based on a fantasy or something.  Don't be afraid to tell your parents what you feel about them, add on extra resentment to your feelings if you feel like it.

I'd like to assume they are someone who loves their daughter more than 'log kya kahenge' bullshit. At least, it was the case for me and my sister. The ultimatum to choose between their son and not talking to them for over 2 months plus not staying in home for more than what's required to sleep, brush, and shit sure showed them that I was serious with my threats. 

Indian society sure does teach their children to be a headless chicken in pursuit of their parent's dreams. If you think you need your parents, in the future, maybe consider for a second that you probably don't need them. I am going to go out on a limb and drop an unpopular opinion - you are not obligated to love your parents. You are not obligated to do shit for them. But they, on the other hand, are obligated to look after you. If they treat you like human, you treat them the same way just like any other person. If they don't, you don't either. I would 100% advice you to be as blunt as possible with your parents now. Tell them exactly how you feel not just about your career but also about your relation with them in the future, even if it sours your relationship with them now. Personally, it made the relationship between me and my mother a lot stronger than it was even if they went into the gutter a for a couple of years in between. Simple thing

As simple as that. True. People judge tiktok users a lot though as if they are beneath them. Just like all social media it has its cons but banning it just because someone thinks its cringe is stupid. It is source of happiness for many and a platform to showcase talent for a few. One man's cringe is another man's entertainment. But sometimes cringe is so strong! It's unbearable. Most of them are novice Uninstalled all social media why ?

"One of my teachers in our school beats students very inhumanely, help !  Long ago, when I studied in KV Firozpore Cantt, we also had a sports teacher, Mr Sharma who used to beat up the kids, especially the small ones from the primary section. One day, he beat up one such kid and broke his leg with a hockey stick. What he did not know was that the kid's elder brother was the local goon. Result: Sharmaji ended up in the hospital the next day with several broken ribs and fingers. After some months he returned to his job but never again touched a child. Post it on Twitter to @NCPCR_ - the national commission for protection of child rights. Don't even bother with videos or anything - just tell them that this is happening and it's not right. 

It's illegal to physically punish a child in India. He has no right to beat a defenseless little kid. 

Also please ask your parents to complain to the police or to the district magistrate. Il Write a letter to your principal signed by everyone in your class, if he/she already knows about it write it to CBSE or whichever board you have, also to education ministry telling in depth of incidents. Go to the police with an adult and report it immediately. Why are sports teacher always so sadistic? Why do they have a case of repressed anger? From someone elses quora answer: 

>  Beating or abusing a student is a punishable offence under
RTE Act, 2009 Section 17( 1) 17(2),
JJ Act, 2000,
IPC
Section 305,
Section 323,
Section 325,
Section 326,
Section 352,
And above that it is cruel and sadistic…..

As someone else said, first step would be to go to the principal/teacher.
Second step would be to go to the police.

You can also try using this feature: https://www.childlineindia.org/a/report/case , there is an option to keep your contact details confidential. Arrange for video shooting the act. Post it in Twitter, describing the situation, mention education and HRD misinsters in the tweet. Sports teachers are usually temporary. If parents come together and complain, they can remove him I am truly sorry this is happening. It boils my blood.

Get adults/parents involved as soon as possible. Convince them to reach out to the School and to the Police if it does not stop. Also, ask your classmates/fellow students to do it too, so at least someone would be sensible even if your parents are not being supportive. did you talk to your parents about this? They might help you by talking to the principle. Have you told your parents about this?

IF you haven't yet, do so now.

Speak to your peers as well and get them to speak to their parents about this, you all can write a petition and go to the principal of the school about it.

If the approach above does not seem like the way you'd want to go, then

"Why are there no indian cheerleaders??  Cheerleading is not a recognised sporting activity India. In fact, it's not very popular outside of the States. While growing in popularity in some western countries, competitive cheerleading is not attached to a lot of sporting events. So, not a lot of what would be called actual cheerleaders would not be found in India. And for IPL, the so called cheerleading was nothing but a commercial eye candy spectacle. Want more people showing up to fill stands, give Indian men white women in skirts to look at. CSK used to have Indian cheerleaders. They even had a guy cheerleader. If I remember correctly there was also something about the colour of our skin. We discriminate a lot (which is also why we don’t see any Latina/Arab or black cheerleaders) Amit Malviya, Tejinder Bugga, Payal Rohatgi would be amazing as cheerleaders They're either gonna get raped, groped, cat called, slut-shamed or all together.

""Aise kapde pehene to mard kya karega?"" I think its the same reason why we don't have strip clubs. Our society looks down on it because its not pure or its against godliness all that stuff. Must be something about indian mentality. Cheerleading is probably down there with lap dancing and mujhra dancing. People think it's a low job that doesn't deserve any respect. Until this changes then you probably wont see indian cheerleaders on google youtube etc. Its really sad as there is nothing wrong with this type of work. CSK, KKR and the defunct PWI have Indian cheerlearders donning traditional clothes. Google Images should give you some pics! I guess when IPL started, Lalit Modi and the powers at that time decided to import the cheerleaders to get more eyeballs in, and that trend has continued.

"What do Indians think of MMA?  >One experienced mma fighter can withstand 5 goons.

Chotta bheem can plug a volcano with a rock, I'd say we should forget MMA and focus on analysing the contents of tun tun mausi's laddus instead. I don’t know if one mma fighter can withstand five goons.  A street fight with weapons and shit is a different story.  Dick kick and run is the best strategy.  I love mma though > One experienced mma fighter can withstand 5 goons

Uttar Pradesh: *Not when the goons have a gun.* You've never done MMA, have you? Any martial arts? Bas bollywood dekhke bolte hoge ki Tiger Shroff paach ko mar deta hoga?

Taekwondo learner

First of all, India is **not** against MMA, I don't see people lashing out about it. Its just its not been implemented well enough. Anyways we are doing pretty good in boxing, TaeKwonDo, ever local park I see has a teacher teaching some form of martial art to kids.

Is your problem that people are *specifically* being taught MMA? Well start and institute and start teaching people. Noone thought about it maybe? Oh wait you can't because you don't know MMA, which is evident by ""One experienced MMA fighter can withstand five gooons"" First off, take a close look at the name: **MIXED** MARTIAL ARTS. It encompasses multiple martial arts disciplines, three of the most popular being  boxing / kickboxing (strikes), Pancrase (grappling / takedowns) and Brazilian Jiujitsu (ground submissions).

Of these three, other than striking, the rest are dangerous (if not useless) in a street fight. In a street fight, you're looking to harm your opponent to make him incapable of hitting you back. Unless one knows how to strike properly and guard properly, he's going to get his ass whooped in no time.

Better to learn something like Krav Maga and boxing for self-defense. A well-thrown punch to the jaw is enough to stun your opponent, if not knock him down.

MMA is good as a sport, not as a self-defense technique. Go to Shakha, they will teach you MMA is more geared towards sport, in an organized environment, with safety rules. It no doubt provides general fitness and conditioning in addition to teaching the essentials - how to punch and not break your fingers/knuckles when you so do. To generate a proper heel kick without sufficient practice will end up as a joke at best and toe fracture at worst. 

Street fight is in a whole different league - It is Chaos. In a fight where you are not merely aiming to win but cause wanton harm to other requires an extremely different mindset. I can imagine myself throwing a couple of punches but I inwardly cringe at the mere thought of gouging someone's eyes out or a throat punch to the adam's apple. If I can't even think of it in a relaxed surrounding, I'm damn sure that in a pressurized environment, it will not even occur to me.  

Most fights are determined in the first two minutes. I have never seen or been in a fight that has lasted more than 2 minutes. Fighting is difficult and leaves most gasping for breath after the initial flurry of activity. It is never like how its portrayed in mass media or entertainment. Further, a lot of extraneous factors also weigh in. The punch thrown by a 75 kg fellow and a 90 kg fellow will be so different, its like the distinction between being hit by a car and a train.   If weapons are involved, no one can predict how its gonna turnout. 

Unless someone is extremely adept at a particular martial art, it makes no difference in an extreme situation. My friend was learning Aikido for close to 4 years and in an incident last year, I got a lesser ass whooping than him, simply because I chose to run away earlier when that idiot was doing some Avatar air-bending shit which looked comical.  

However, this is not to say that the martial arts are useless unless mastered. They have an unique use - you learn how to take affordable hurt. Someone who has practiced martial arts gets an intuitive feeling of where it will hurt less. How many of you know that a punch to the nipple, even accidentally, hurts almost the same as a dick kick ? - I thought since it is chest and ribs, its not a big deal. How wrong I was! While I found that out by suffering it, my friend instinctively knew to avoid it even though his aikido was useless. If a dumb fuck like me stands straight exposing his chest and stomach, they would stand in a posture which will present a very minimal area to hurt. He is still going to get punched but it will hurt far less. 

All this is to say: Never buy into the story that martial arts can make you Bruce Lee or Ip Man. Most of the martial arts taught in India are sport variants and mostly useless in close combat. And fighting multiple opponents is something which requires extraordinary skill and mindset. 

If someone thinks merely practicing MMA would be sufficient for defense, its a mistaken mind. It would be like masturbation - Provide you feelings of happiness, self-sufficiency and some endorphins but all you would be doing is fucking yourself with an illusion.",AskIndia

"[General] What is your opinion about the IITs? Do you think they're worth it? What should be done to fix the obviously flawed institutions and their admission process?  Fuck IIT. We don't need any more quora users around us. /s

But on serious note, IITs are one of the few options of becoming 1.6lpm earner in 4 years and can help a lower middle class person jump to upper middle class.

If you feel you aren't cut-out for IIT thats okay. There isn't a need to discredit that institution with made up stories. Cracking JEE and getting admission into an IIT has become more oriented around getting that celebrity status (you'll already know if an IIT is living in a radius of 50 KM or... three in-laws relations). 
I have seen Indian parents worshipping IITian like literally putting them on a pedestal, a prodigy, an example to your spoiled brat. It's more because of the hype of IITs. 
I remember vividly, when I was in 10th and one of my friends asked me - ""*Will you go for IIT?*"" , at that time I have no idea about even it's existence, it was like some new fad everyone's talking about.
I won't say JEE is biased though. But the competition has given to a varieties of problems. Depression, anxiety, anti-social living has become the pre-requisites for an IITian. We have to tackle this somehow before it's too late to be dealt with. Look, I get all the lack of research and creativity and all that stuff... But the fact of the matter is that an IITian tag is something that almost guarantees a better professional and social life.

An institute is much more than its admission process. The access to resources, alumni network, placecom networks, seniors etc is something that will give you a huge advantage all your life. They are worth I. What I have seen so far. But that’s because their curriculum is designed that way. Nothing extraordinary when compared to US education. System but stands out in our Indian educational process. But what I strongly dislike in them the most is their attitude at  workplaces. They behave like beyond genius, and form their own group and cult and won’t let anyone else mingle. They are snobbish and highly irritating group. That’s, by far, my experience so far. I could be wrong and their could be exceptions. Yes, if you wanna join 1.6lpm club asap > The admission process involves how fast you can apply the memorized formula to a specific type of question, it doesn't require you to approach the question in an innovative way which would force you to think about it.

Actually this is not true. The reason the exam is difficult is actually because you have to think in an innovative way about the problem.

> I could go on and on about how the system is flawed, how they should introduce western ways to take in students which both supports extra-curricular activities, overall creativity, communication and sports

IITs have the best infrastructure in India, so I doubt the situation is as bad as you're saying it is. 

> In conclusion, I don't think they're worth 3-4 years of life the students have to sacrifice in order to get these institutions

Maybe not 3-4 years, but they are definitely worth sacrificing 2 years, which most people do. As someone studying in a ""Tier 2"" college now, IITs are miles ahead of us. IMO you should definitely try your hardest to crack the exam. >The admission process involves how fast you can apply the memorized  formula to a specific type of question, it doesn't require you to  approach the question in an innovative way which would force you to  think about it.

I LOLed so hard at this. These papers are no joke and do require a lot of practice and deep thinking to be able to crack it. 4 years ago One of my teachers in FIITJEE said that if your hardwork must compensate for the deficiency in IQ. People some require 2 hours, some may require 5 hours and some may require 10.

The most amusing part of this paper is that you seem to be confident that I am well prepared and when you see the paper, it's on an entirely new fucking pattern with new types of question. At that point, you must dynamically adjust yourself and 2 years of prepartion else you are screwed.

>I don't think they're worth 3-4 years of life the students have to  sacrifice in order to get these institutions, the pressure and lack of  social interaction

You haven't seen anything. I am in my final year from a non-IIT govt college. Even though I simply cannot be anymore thankful to the govt for the facilities provided for basically peanuts, screwing up JEE is the biggest regret of mine till date.

I went to IIT Fests, did my internship from IIT and believe me, they are worth your perseverance and dedication you put in for 2-3 years.

I am a placed person. I got a package of 7.15 lpa and I cannot be any happier about it but my people who never put as much effort as me got double the package of mine just because they are from IIT (particularly IIT D).

It's a tag worth fighting for. At least you won't regret that you didn't give it a shot. The amount of shit thrown at IITs is unreal.

They are the best institutions in the country for a reason. For all the complaints about shitty admission exam (it's actually not shitty, it relies less on memory power than any other entrance exam in India), I can guarantee you that an average IITian is better than an average student from other institutions.

Yes, the iitian ego is real but that doesn't taint the fact that the institutions are undoubtedly the best in India right now. 

Regarding the complaints about research, you should keep in mind that the Mtechs or PhDs in IITs are not the ones who did undergrad in IITs (who passed that admission test). Rather, they are undergrads in other non-IIT colleges. To gauge how IITian research is, you have to go through the research progress of foreign universities (whatever Tier you pick, IITians are ubiquitous. You can even find profs there who did their undergrad in IITs). So, your complaint about research should really be targeted at how bad the undergrad studies in non-IITs are.

"Are there no centrists in India who are not completely polarised by political ideologies and are objective in assessing & supporting Govts based only on their administration?  I have little problem being objective if a party is anchored towards moderation and liberalism in governance.

BJP under Vajpayee was still rightwing hindutva but didn't go crazy with social engineering or illiberalism, and stuck to the secular constitutional principles prevalent till then. I didn't like some of their lapses such as the 2002 pogrom and attempts at saffronizing education then, but I also had no problem appreciating the nuclear tests, the NH network, Kalam's nomination as president, the Kargil victory, and even the post-parliament attack kashmir standoff.

Similarly, I appreciate congress of the 90s and 00s for their economic developments, Nehru's nation building, RTI and NREGA UBI under MMS. At the same time, I absolutely hated Indira and Sanjay's authoritarianism that resulted in enduring degeneration of Indian politics, corruption of people like Kalmadi, MMS saying he's helpless about corruption due to ""coalition dharma"", poor governance in my state of Karnataka under Rahul Gandhi's insipid leadership. 

It's possible to be objective about moderate politicians and parties.

But BJP under Modi and Shah turned out to be a whole different ballgame. Till end-2015 or so, I assumed Modi had matured on being made PM, come out of his Gujrat pogrom mindset, and himself become a ""centrist"". I even remember mentally appreciating the rafale ready-to-fly deal of 2015 thinking here's somebody more efficient than our babus. Then slowly the incessant shitshow started and has never stopped from 3 years - biased jingoistic media, demo craziness, incessant propaganda, IT cell mischief, fake news, murder of a judge, supreme court bench fixing, lynchings, complicated GST, electoral bonds, Rafale corruption, NRC social engineering, Kashmir fiasco.

This is not just another party. I see them as now as literally extremists of the taliban variety, who also happen to be dishonest, incapable, corrupt and authoritarian. A political mafia is what they are. It's not mentally possible for me to appreciate the ""good"" deeds of such extremists. It's the equivalent of hearing ""yes, asaram and his son molested young girls but so what? at least he built schools too"". Some roads built or some gas cylinders handed out doesn't redeem extremists. Let them turn themselves away from their current path and return governance back towards liberal constitutionalism and institutional democracy, and then we can think of returning to centrism. I'm pretty sure that there are centrists among us. It's just that the mindset of ""If you're not with us, you're against us"" is strongly reinforced in our current political climate. If a person supports a certain initiative, they are lumped into the party that leads it. Being lumped comes with the assumption that the person shares the same ideology of said political party which, for the most part, is true. There are exceptions, of course (like being a centrist).     

Objectively looking at decisions is pretty straightforward. If only making decisions in real time were that simple.

By leaving this country Why are you letting your father dictate your decisions? Take a transfer back to Nagpur while looking for better opportunities. Meanwhile can you carefully & secretly record (video & audio) your interactions with your boss? This is in case you ever need it as an insurance policy against her bullying.    

Given the current economic and unemployment scenario, I'd advise you to not leave your job unless you have a firm offer in hand.Till then you can try de-stressing techniques like playing your favourite sport,yoga,, or a hobby. They'll also prevent you from slipping into depression. If  you're feeling suicidal, please start individual therapy with a trained psychologist immediately. The psychologist might recommend a psychiatrist to prescribe medication if it's severe. There's nothing shameful or wrong about getting medical help when you need it. 

Your father is less concerned about your mental health and personal happiness than is about 'log kya kahenge' (T: आपले नातेवाईक काय म्हणतील? समाज काय म्हणेल?) because that's probably what he has seen. And maybe he doesn't realise the extent of your depression. What you need to realize, however, is that only if you're happy can you keep anyone else happy. Gray rock him while your transfer/ other job works out. 

I'd also advise postponing marriage till you're a bit more happier in your life. A new wife and in-laws will add to your responsibility and your plate's already full with your unhappiness and dissatisfaction. Also you need to move out of father's shadow and start taking your own decisions before you accept the responsibility of your own family.

Wonder how much the media rights for a U-17 women's football were acquired for (maybe free, it has only 4 teams). It's being organized by FSDL which is a Reliance subsidiary. For a newly launched event getting listed on streaming sites like hotstar and jio would be a boon. They stream F1. <3 Does it work with Chromecast? To the football fans, Hotstar is definitely a treat, up along with Jio TV which also shows some not so top level matches .

And even *Full Replays*…!! 

Its so amazing.

If I miss a match somehow due to timing etc, I can just see  the Replay

It's definitely better than Prime or slightly better at the same price range

The only downside being its data consumption being too high, higher than Netflix and Prime Video. Where can I watch wrc races? I took the vip subscription just to watch ISL.

"I(21F)Can't decide if my bf(28M) is showing red flags and doesn't respect me enough or if I'm being too insecure and not trusting him enough  You two are not a match.

There is nothing wrong in your expectations, or his behaviour. They are all choices people make. He seems certain about what he wants. You too, are certain, and when he crosses those lines, you are uncomfortable.

A relationship is about compromise. But compromise even if grudging initially, has to finally become one of happy acceptance. Otherwise, the insecurities will eat away at it slowly. He doesn't seem to be particularly compromising to me. You seem to be compromising, but very uncomfortably.

If possible, meet a therapist. Have a few sessions. A good therapist helps you clarify your own feelings and communicate them to yourself. That will help you decide. Is r/India going to be a relationship consultancy sub? Wow, this is a toughie.

Your insecurity is very valid, but at the same time, I can't really see anywhere your boyfriend incurred any serious red flags.

I'm sorry about the way his female friend / coworker treated you, that isn't right and you were right to ask him to not meet with her anymore (I would never date anyone whose friends gave me any racist comments of any kind, and I'm sure it wasn't in a joking manner). So kudos on that, and as for the instagram thing, I wouldn't worry too much unless he is known to be very active on Instagram (many people just have the app installed and look at it from time to time, not really paying attention to who they follow or who is following them).

Here is where the real advice for you lies:

When your boyfriend was vacationing in Las Vegas for hiring escorts and visiting strip clubs, you said, in your own words, and I quote: ""Before he left I told him I'm not comfortable with these kind of activities but asked him to enjoy the trip.""

I can understand giving your partner space, but giving your boyfriend permission to go to a strip club even if it makes you uncomfortable reeks of insecurity. If giving your boyfriend permission to go to a strip club makes you uncomfortable (I would very much be uncomfortable with my partner going to a strip club, even with friends) then ask him to stop (this is a very legitimate request and especially more so in your case, since you two are thinking of getting married soon).

Going forward, I would ask what your boyfriend is doing in Miami (as well as any situation), and I want to ask yourself:

Am I uncomfortable with where my boyfriend is going and what he is doing? If yes, why?

If you have a legitimate reason (hint: escorts and strip clubs are very much a legitimate reason).

Then address it to him in a clear, straightforward manner. Remember, communication is key in relationships and marriages.

As for whether your boyfriend's friend is a good influence or not, it's tricky (namely because you may not like the lifestyle, but the other party is free to make their own choices), because on one hand, you may think they aren't, but another hand, you don't want to overstep your boundaries (telling your partner that a friend is a bad influence can be seen as controlling unless the friend has been known to inflict emotional and / or physical pain on your partner). So I wouldn't worry too much (about the friend) until the friend puts a strain on your relationship (which makes it pertinent to discuss what you think about him).

So going forward, I would advise you communicate to your partner about how you feel where he is going and what he is doing, don't be afraid to have a discussion on it.

Communicate. Communicate. Communicate. He seems to simply be from a more.....liberal(?) background than you. There will be unavoidable culture shock involved.

Just ask yourself whether you can tolerate it, then discuss it with your fiance. Following that, you may also talk to your own friends and family to ease matters.

And good luck. :) Now is the time to contemplate and avoid any forseeable emotional trauma. It is difficult to understand what your or your bf thinks since its not clear of both of u are born and bought up in US or born in India and are living in US for last few years or born in Indian and moved to US as child. That defines the characteristics and let other understand the mentality.

As an Indian guy living in US, it is common to be attracted to the western culture and be able to be a part of it. Getting a lap dance is a common practice but escort is not. When a bf or gf starts making comments on things that their partner hadn't thought about, it is normal for your partner to panic. He might genuinely being a friend with that woman and your comment(s) may made him think you were narrow minded that led him to not tell you everything.

That being said, these type of situations are typically paradox for not knowing the other end of story. The best I can or I believe anyone can suggest is to express yourself and how you feel to your bf. If you've had enough understanding of him, you'd feel or realize if there was a lie. Just don't jump onto any conclusions. Do your best to understand what he's really doing. You're not ready to be married.

Enjoy life, try to find someone who is matching you. Who goes to Vegas on vacation and doesn't go to a strip club? What is this world coming to? > I asked him to please stop all nonwork related contact with her and he agreed.

Which is good

> Before he left I told him I'm not comfortable with these kind of activities but asked him to enjoy the trip.... My bf just told me yesterday that he's planning on spending new year's eve with the same friend this year in miami.

Well, you didnt tell him not to so he didnt.

I guess you wanted him to realize that you want him to stop, by himself. That hasnt happened. You should say so.

I dont see any red flags tbh. But, for someone living in the west you are pretty conservative. He isnt as conservative. And that makes for a bad match. OP, do you really want to spend your life worried that your partner might cheat on you? There are plenty of decent human beings (like your partner, I’ll assume it’s a good person with a different lifestyle), who may lead life the way you do. 

&#x200B;

You are 21. You are going to spend hours and hours in a high-pressure job. No one is forcing you to marry someone who’s lifestyle doesn’t work for you, so why do this to yourself? It’s only a matter of time before you start getting gaslight for felling the way you feel. Why put your future at risk?

Being a hardworking person with different interests is fantastic. Best of luck. You guys have a communication problem.

"What is wrong with India? Please share your perception.  Resources vs population ratio is very very low. See mostly how insensitive people are to other people is the reason. I have observed how people have this urge in themselves to judge others and think bad of them is, and I too have been there. Being grown up that way, maybe everyone has. 

Parents are insensitive to their children, most of them just have them coz society tells them to else they don't give a damn how is their child especially mentally, when its college time they order them to do a specific course as if they know the best while they don't know a single thing about their child. Yes there is change coming in this behaviour but there is still majority who will say it's bullshit and they own their children. They say that their children must study what they want them to, score what they want them to, love who they want them to and marry. Their talent is constantly suppressed at every step to the level they just become a follower when they had capability to be a leader.

Man is supposed to be loved and respected by his family even if he beats his wife, shouts at his children, have no social life whatsoever and is completely not understanding. 

People say their is equality but obviously they have to constantly remind themselves which group other person belongs to so ofcourse there is huge negativity to question of intercaste or interreligious marriage which inturn is best solution to vanish discrimination.

Even our newspaper do this discrimination, just read matrimonial section there, women needs to be fair always, less educated than groom always, have to cook, and will have to obey the order when family says no to work and ofcourse has to be of same caste and religion.

Man and even women believe girls are to be controlled that when they ask for freedom they deserve to be raped. There is so much filth in minds of people.

We are constantly been forced to love our parents no matter how wrong they are, respect elders no matter how bad their deeds are and on top of them believe in God that he will do everything good. Well I can say is society wants us to just support and obey things blindly and most of them are pathetic. As a country, we are just at that stage. Every country goes through a phase like this. But we have technology. It's up to us as to how we use the tech to make or break us. I won't even say religion. I'd say the caste system is a really fucked up thing than most people realize. My imaginary friend is better than your imaginary friend Indians are what is wrong with India. Herd mentality with rigid perceptions I think you're comparing India with first world countries. And let me remind you that even first world countries faced these issues when they were young. Every country has its issues no country is perfect. Even the first world countries have misogyny, racism & rigging, etc. 

India is a young country compatriot. It's still evolving and rest assured it'll shed all those features you've mentioned and will become an ideal country.

Jai hind. My mom started clapping once the verdict was out. And she said that India belongs to Hindus and that Muslims must be driven out. I'm just speechless. I don't know what to do.. I told her that it's such a backward thought. She didn't care. She just sat down to pray.

I can't believe it. Ostensibly people also have a restricted mindset, they are not open to changes.Cant blame anyone though, we have always been thought to not do mistakes, to follow the rules, trying something new is at our own risk.People, inclusive of me sometimes, deny to change their beliefs that we have held dearly are have been comfortable with.

Because I am one of the few people who understand these issues.

Because India sucking is as much a fault of the knowledged staying silent as that of the stupid ruling the roost.

Also, how long did it take you to get fluent in German? [deleted] Hi,
As someone living in Germany for quite some while and familiar other parts of Europe as well, which countries do you see having well established or a booming IT/tech industry at the moment/in the near future? 


Also, in terms of quality of life, ease of integration/emigration, and racial attitudes, and in general the culture how would you rank these countries?

Asking because I'm looking at emigrating to Europe as an option and would love to know your perspective. Ok, it seems like you're having a really good time in Germany and your quality of life is extremely well. I'm happy for you for that. You've risen out of the struggles of India and found some peace and breathing room in a more stable place. Good for you. I mean that.

Now, is it possible for you to return to Hyderabad permanently and still find a way to sustain yourself and those that depend on you financially? Considering you're a techie, there is a good (enough) market for software developers here so I think that is possible. If so, what is stopping you from doing that?

The reason I'm asking this is because you seem like an above average and sharp person. You've also had experience abroad which a lot of people do not have here. With all that in mind, your perspective and passion will be invaluable and the same goes for your siblings. If you're this passionate about your country while staying abroad, imagine what you could do for your country, your city or even just your locality if you were living here? So why aren't you here?

One reason could be that you really aren't financially stable enough to shift here, and that's ok. If that's not the case then the only reason left is that your passion is misplaced. You are only worrying about your ""home"" because you feel like you *should* or because you have family living there. When in reality you've subconsciously accepted your new home in Germany. It's either that or something else that explains why you're not in India trying to help with these problems you've mentioned.

See, all I'm hearing from your post is ""Please make the city more livable"". A plea coming from a non-resident Indian who will never go through the difficulties of achieving that goal (because he doesn't and won't live here) but expects the locals to do so. And inshallah we will do so, but not to set up cushions for you but to furnish our own cities.

Your post implies that us citizens are wilfully producing and promoting this black, ""shitty air"" that you mention when in fact, just in case you didn't know, we don't want this air just as much as you (actually, we don't want it more than you because we have to breathe it every day). This, if nothing else, keeps us motivated to change that and since we *are* living here we can directly try to change that.

So you can see why a rant about our ""shitty cities"" can sound hypocritical to our ears when we're trying to fix things here and someone who has just about none of a dog left in the race tells us to ""make the city more livable"". It sounds very condescending, like a rich merchant asking the poor peasants to ""hurry up and stop being poor"".

We're trying.

(And when I say ""you"" in this post I mean to point to every NRI that rants about the ""situation in India"" but hasn't contributed to anything significant to help with it.)

> do I miss it? Nah! Do I miss the culture? absolutely yes! Do I want to come back and live there? Nope.

I don't know why I wrote all this. You've said it yourself; you only want the good parts without having to have worked to remove the bad parts.

---

Also, I don't know why you're worried about coming to Hyderabad as a Muslim. I'm not the most politically educated but even I can tell you that Hyderabad is possibly the safest place for an Indian Muslim to live in (particularly a Hyderabadi Muslim). If you don't believe that then either I'm wrong or you've just proven how out-of-touch you are with your culture.  [u/ppcontentrobot](https://www.reddit.com/user/ppcontentrobot/), I wouldn't disagree with anything. You are pitch perfect on what's wrong in the country and I wouldn't blame you for choosing a better quality of life.

I wish I could just raise a wand and change the way things work in our country but unfortunately I just can't. So, I came down here and asked the world what's wrong and how we can influence change? Jingle bells, I wasn't cut out for what came back.

**If there is one thing I am sure of, it is of the fact that we just can't keep doing this forever.** 

Things around emigration will change drastically in the next decade and it will no longer be cut out for everyone. I wish we don't have to wait till we get hit to reform change.",AskIndia

"Do people get socially / personally alienated because they're not interested / scared of pets?  Along with being a foodie, wanderlust, sapiosexual etc., love of pets has been a forced trend of sorts. This sub too caught on that trend lately. 

Getting out of marriage is understandable if they strongly want a pet and you are totally against it. However, alienating people just because they don't like pets is taking things to the extreme. I think if you are a nice person in general, people will like you. If someone makes a massive deal out of you not liking animals, you're better off without them. I mean, avoiding or ostracising people over something they like (interests like animals, movies, etc.) don't like is a very shallow and childish way to behave.

I knew a person who hated pets. Or any animals. I and a lot of people disliked her, but not for her hating animals. She was just an asshole in general. Regarding the marriage alliance, why would she want to be with someone who doesn't want the same things in life? For her, her pet dog was probably more important than some random person. Obviously, she's gonna reject the person who has clearly told her that he doesn't want pets. Many Animal lovers won't spare a change to a poor kid, won't buy him a meal but would spend lakhs on their dogs. Petting an animal is ok but when you equate a dog's life with a human's life, I don't want to do anything with you.

These fucking assholes would feed the stray dogs inside the building complex. Those stray dogs kept coming inside and started barking at soceity members. If you're feeding a dog, do it outside.

A couple of months ago, couple of stray dogs killed a kid and these fucking assholes had the gall to put blame on him saying that dogs are loyal, they won't harm you. Fuck that shit. They won't take new stray dogs nor their NGOs will do that but won't let the officials kill them. Wtf. I had to physically fight off these stray dogs when I was a kid with a bat.

Haven't you heard of Karen's who live with their cats when they're old as they couldn't find someone who could love them? Yeah, I have seen couple of those in Mumbai.

If you want to maintain your sanity, I'd advise you to stay away from them. Couples in the west divorce over pets. Let these cunts die with their catshit.

I just stay away from them and let them do what they want.

Edit : This is mostly for cats and dogs. I'm fine with rabbits, parrots, birds etc. I had a parrot as a pet. I share the same feeling. Infact i once had a heated argument about it.
I am still not sure about the ethical issue here. So a rich lady with a fancy dog won't spare a single penny for the hungry kid outside her car window in a traffic light signal. 
I have seen people spending over 20k on their dogs monthly and not a single penny for charity. I don't understand this behaviour. The social capital of a human is anyday greater than dogs, i believe. I may be wrong here though. Do you live in india ? Because I haven't came across such hardcore dog or cat lovers here . I would say animal hierarchy in our country goes like this 
1. Cow
2. Other domestic animals like Buffalo's
3. Dogs
4.lion
5.elephant

"Stuff to do in Andaman/In around port-blair with family/elderly  Monsoon season is off season in A&N. So, less people. Do early morning scuba diving on Havelock preferably ( I know you didn't want adventure sports, but should try this). Cellular Jail visit on Port Blair. Beautiful beaches on all islands. Visit sentinel islands. /s Stuff not to do- Don't litter, no plastic, don't speak loud, control kids. Stuff to do-  you have white sand beaches, cellur jail tour, boat rides to islands, Nicobar Island sighting. That's it Plan for a trip post October as monsoons in Andaman mean inter-island ferries getting cancelled and beaches not being that much attractive.

If you are planning to go to Havelock or Neil, book your ferries well in advance, as October is the start of the peak season.

There is nothing much to do in Port Blair itself, apart from the historical sights. You can take a trip to Ross Island and Chidiya Tapu (there is a nice 1 hour forest trek at the end of the beach). 2 days in PB are more than enough. If you plan to visit Baratang island, add another day here. I would have suggested visiting Jolly Buoy island (probably the best sight in PB) but it is closed in Oct. The alternative is Red Skin island, which is not nearly as good and is not worth visiting from what I heard.

As far as Havelock and Neil, spend at least 2 and 1 days each respectively in there. If you can do scuba diving, you should. If that is not an option, then I'd tell you to do snorkeling as any trip to the Andaman is incomplete without getting a peek into the rich marine life and coral reef. There is no fitness requirement or need to know swimming for snorkeling and everyone including elderly people can do it (and also do it).

Visit a neighborhood school and talk to the principal. Be clear with them and ask them to suggest a child who is unable to pay fees . Tell the school you will pay for that child.
But it is also important to be non-judgmental. Just because you provide an opportunity doesn't imply that someone will take it. When I was in class 10, an elderly retired centr al government officer donated me an amount one time for buying books and stationary. I will never forget his help.

"Indians who have lost weight, how did you manage the dieting part?  Water man. It's just crazy how amazing water is. If you struggle with unusual cravings even when you've just had your meal, increase your hydration. It is hypothesised that the ""thirst centre"" and ""hunger centre"" within the hypothalamus are adjacent. So at times, when you're actually thirsty, you start feeling hungry. Therefore, at times, adequate hydration may help you overcome the desire to consume something snackable when you don't need to. 

The reverse worked for me as I tried to lose weight. I replaced small snacks with water. And water based foods are really good too. There's also some zero calorie foods and negative calorie foods, but that's mostly just conjecture. However, sometimes when I'm doing intermittent fasting I'll allow myself a cup of green tea which claims to be zero calories. 

As far as modification is concerned, first and foremost, cut out all accessory food items. Biscuits with tea. Papad with lunch. Don't try stepping out of your comfort zone too fast. You'll just panic that way. Make small decisions that lead to small victories. And yeah, record these victories if you can, they're a great source of motivation.

If you have a medical condition that requires weight loss like hypertension or diabetes, do consult your physician if you decide to supplement your diet with exercise. The only thing that works for me is Intermittent Fasting, and eating around 1200 calories. I’m a girl and about 5’7. For me calorie in and calorie out is what works. I only started working out after I lost the weight coz working out makes me hungry and eat more. So I've lost 8 kgs from the start of this year. I did a couple of things. First I Stopped eating all sorts of processed sugars. No sugar in tea coffee no soft drinks and cut down alcohol consumption to 20% of last year. I drink chaach to fulfill my cravings for a cold drink. 

The second thing was I stopped eating junk food. No Regular pizza burger outside. If I feel like eating something I order healthy alternatives to the regular stuff. 

Third I started taking stairs instead of elevators for up to 4th floor. 

That's all. Did nothing special in terms of diet or anything just small changes in lifestyle. Go gluten free and dairy free and eliminate sugar , your body will take a few days to adjust but eventually your taste buds adjust and your cravings stop, though i know going completely gluten free is next to impossible in India , try to minimize it as much as you can. Just start to eat less, small steps. 
Start with running and exercise, then at the same time, eat fewer portions. Meal prep would be too difficult at the start for you. In addition to what's already been mentioned, set a cheat day once every 10-15 days. Tell yourself and around you that you're allowed pizza(or whatever you like but can't eat) etc. on that day if you follow the diet for the remaining days.

Helps as a great motivator, while also postponing your cravings. You've already got some amazing advice in this post, but since you mentioned your interest in learning how to cook for eating healthy I'd like to encourage you to pursue it because more than anything else eating healthy is the best thing you can do for your body.

When you think about learning how to cook please don't look forward to Sanjeev Kapoor or Gordon Ramsey style of cooking. Cooking simple food is not difficult at all, you don't need any recipe books or fancy ingredients. Put an unpeeled and uncut potato with a handful of some dry pulse or beans in a water pot and boil it long enough for the food to break down, add a pinch of salt and you are done. Eat it with freshly baked bread, steamed buns, or chappatis, whichever of these you can manage on your own.

You need to learn how to appreciate the natural flavour of foods without adding butter, oil, salt, sugar and spices. It will fill you up and keep you healthy. I lost weight by exercising and dieting. Mu family, prefers oil rich food. I changed my eating habits in the following ways
1. Have dinner before 8, i sleep by 11.
2. I replaced all the snack i ate with fruits, difficult food like sunflower seeds. I say difficult because u have to peel it first and then eat it. U can also try pumpkin seeds and muskmelon seeds- with the shell
3. Ate atleast one meal that was made by me with no oil etc.There are a lot of meal prep videos that can be helpful. 
4. Lastly increase water intake. I made a conscious effort of drinking half a glass of water every waking hour.
These things worked for meGood luck  ! Calories in < calories out + Indeterminate fasting + Water.",AskIndia

"Please help this white girl and suggest a good South Indian chicken recipe  If you have a pressure cooker, there is a very easy to make, tasty and healthy chicken recipe. My dad used to enjoy this alot with his single malt every evening. 

For 1 KG chicken you will need 2 onions 3 tomatoes and about 2 cups of water. 

* Add 2 tbsp oil or ghee to pressure cooker and heat.
* Add cardmom, cumin seeds, cinnamon, clove, green chilli and fry a little. 
* Once spices are fragnant, add sliced onion and a pinch of salt. Let it fry till golden brown. 
* Add pureed tomatoes, kashmiri red chilli powder, turmeric and salt. 
* Fry till oil/ghee separates. 
* Add chicken, mix it well. Add water and close the pressure cooker. 
* Cook for 2 whistles and let the steam escape before you open. 

* Mix in chicken masala and garam masala and simmer for 10 minutes. 

It is ready. 
This goes very well with brown rice or as it is. 

Sorry there is no coconut in there but it tastes soo good. Try these search terms, they are 4 different types of curry:

1) Kerala style chicken curry  ( a coconut milk preparation)

2) Chicken Kondattam ( a spicy dry kind of curry - my fav) 

3) Pallipalayam chicken ( I haven't got the hang of cooking this one, but it's supposed to be with dry whole spices.) 

4) Kerala style chicken stew (mild white/ yellow color curry with coconut milk and green chilli, not red chilli unlike earlier recipes)

Sides - not very south Indian, but you can try making naans or any type of Indian flatbread. These can be made with whole wheat or all purpose flour. South Indian flat breads are made of rice / rice flour. A typical South Indian one is called Appam. Not sure you would have all the ingredients for that to hand. I'd suggest lookup on YouTube. Mainly it will help you understand many ingredients/spices to visualize and find it on local grocery stores. Ok mochi lover - we have a recipe for you and it is quite straight forward. 

This is chettinad chicken from Madhur Jaffrey:

A slightly changed version from Saveur

https://www.saveur.com/article/recipes/koli-milagu-masala-chettinad-pepper-chicken/

This is as South Indian chicken as it can get. It is full of spices and depending on the red chillies and pepper corns, can either be spicy hot, or just spicy. 

Key points: 

Cook the chicken on low flame. If you want to thicken the sauce, take out the chicken pieces and boil the sauce for sometime to reduce it to the thickness/consistency you prefer. 

The recipe is full of spices, but it gets 'chilly/spicy hot' based on the number of red chillies and the pepper. r/indianfood https://www.youtoocancook.net/search/max-results=7?q=Chicken&m=1

"After arranging food for family by selling his mobile amid lockdown, man hangs self  > In a tragic incident reported from a slum cluster in Saraswati Kunj area in Gurugram, a poor man, in his early 30s, allegedly committed suicide by hanging himself in his tin hutment on Thursday.

But government is playing jumlabaazi even in corona pandemic. Felt bad reading about this the other day. While one lot of the poor are reaping all the benefits & demand more, when have this other side who cannot even make ends meet.

The first lot typically are the vote banks of local politicians, while the second lot are usually the migrant workers without a base who have come to earn their livelihood. This is so heartbreaking... I can't even begin to imagine what must have been going through his mind and yet in his desperation, he thought of his family and children .. And on the other hand, we read media reports of women and children being abused at home... What a stark contrast between the have and the have nots... This is exactly what makes me wonder if the extension of lockdown is helping ppl or is it snatching the last ounce of fighting spirit from ppl who aren't so privileged. Maybe for a decent chunk of population a  3% or 4%  mortality is a  far safer odds than surviving without a livelihood for 40 days. And as that lockdown gets extended more and more ppl are willing to risk those odds No matter where you live, you CAN give food to at least one or two poor families. Your neighbours will see you doing it and some will take your example and do the same. Height of stupidity. People can live for months fasting. His children had food. Not they don't have him.

truth is HORMONES DONT SURVIVE THE TANDOOR you idiots.

7th std biology level knowledge will tell you that hormones are absorbed by their respective organs. the growth hormone isn't just lying there in the chicken, it's absorbed, it does it's job and then more muscle is left for you to eat which is good.

whatever trace hormone may be left is destroyed by the extreme heat you cook the chicken in. 

the level of idiocy and complete lack of common sense in people these days actually gives me a headache sometimes. 

if someone really wants their food without fertilizers and the dreaded ""chemicals"" go live in the fucking stone age. This is purely anecdotal from what I've heard from one of my friends who has a poultry farm, Yes, the chickens are given antibiotics and feed tailored to grow them fatter and larger, they don't harm you much if taken in moderation  
However, I had a friend who ate chicken breast daily for years, and he ended up with hormonal complications.  
There are other less harmful protein sources like Eggs, Fish or mutton you could consider as well. The biggest issue to worry about is the salt water that is injected into commercial chicken (frozen). Each serving is about equal to your daily recommended salt intake, and this causes severe issues for people who already have high blood pressure. 
If you want to eat chicken the best way to procure it is from your local butcher 100%.

I have stopped eating any sort of meat in India. Biryani is life ! It's not true. I've been involved in poultry farming in past. You don't have to give them anything besides food. They already grow extremely fast. So fast that primary concern of farmers is to give them enough food. Because they also eat too much. Usually from chick to all grown chicken only takes around two months. And then you'll have to sell them pretty fast. Because people don't like over grown chicken. In fact after one month a farmer would want to get them grow slower, of course its not possible. Because it will give more time, both to farmer and street seller to sell. Which means more money. Because it needs to be sold within very short period of time, because it grows so fast they sell it to whatever price they get. Which results in loss of money. In fact if you sell three, four batch a year most likely one or two you will have to sell with no profit or loss. Other two will recover your cost. BTW overgrown chicken has fiber like quality in meat that's why seller and buyer don't like it. If you like to make chicken at home you'll understand.",Food

"India Will Become Less Religious If We Had Social Security and Free Healthcare  Bhai, correlation is not causation. Education plays a bigger role with religiosity.

India theoretically has a public healthcare system AND social security. The quality and accessibility is another thing, of course My first impulse is to agree. If we had affordable and universal healthcare for example, the snake oil vending babas and fakirs wouldn’t hold as much sway as they currently do.

But on second thoughts, is this really true? Lots of Muslim majority countries have universal free healthcare. Tunisia for example. That didn’t stop them from being an Islamic State hotbed. Saudi Arabia? The less said the better. Bangladesh, our neighbor has a very robust public health system. And yet, it’s secularism is little more than a fake veneer. Majoritarianism is open and out there for anyone to see.

And then there is Maldives. The country that has the highest number of Islamic State volunteers to the ISIS. 5 people out of 10000 Maldivians went and joined the ISIS.

Edit: had written the Maldivian stat wrong. Corrected. [removed] I may be wrong but among the Indian states Kerela offers the above welfare facilities, due a CPI(M) or INC. Yet among all Indian muslims to join ISIS. I recall Kerela being a hotbed for it.

Can someone explain that correlation? (and I don't mean to offend anyone just curious.) [deleted] People still believe in caste and religion etc because they have been brought up that way. And since most of the people are not keen to learn different points of view the only way its effects can be decreased in our country is time, particularly when the younger generation takes over the old.   


What you said is probably true in India for certain people but most people won't vote for anyone outside their caste (atleast locally) Education and higher standard of living will address this by far. Once people become accustomed to good life without day to day worries there is less tendency to look elsewhere for succor. Religion steps in when people are insecure about their circumstances and believe a higher power controls their destiny which is exploited by charlatans. Sabka maalik ek. People think way more rationally when they are not under alot of stress. In western europe many people are religious but they live a peaceful life, so they avoid risking it all by becoming a religious fanatic. Point being, comfort and rationality are directly correlated. This is my theory of course. Fair enough. 

But for me, as someone earlier stated in this thread, education is the most important factor to reduce the effect of religion. And I am not talking about mere reading, writing, and eventually sending kids to do engineering. I am talking about an education system which encourages students to be more inquisitive. 
Students should always be taught to ask questions and I cannot emphasize this point enough. Through this, students will develop a tendency to critically examine the things they are taught. They will cross check the news they see and ask for concrete proofs for what their parents, teachers, leaders tell them. Eventually, they will realize that theocracy can never provide them such proofs and the arguments it can present is either ambiguous or straight up fictional in nature. Every jumla will be nibbed off before it can reach the masses. 
Teach children to question. Nurture curiosity. Do not allow them to accept things as it is. Here's my take:

It seems to me that core demographics of religion here is lower-middle class and middle class, not the labour class. The very poor are fighting for survival. They may have anxieties, but have no time and means to express their religiosity.

With social security and health care, the most poor will be benefited the most. They can now address their anxieties. They will now go to religion with hope.

"Infected pizza boy: Online food delivery orders drop 30%  As a stranded tourist: If food delivery is cancelled I starve 🥴 not stonks Drone delivery is required Has there been any case against Mojo Pizza for letting the sick employee work? My society banned delivery orders after this, which is so fucking retarded. I was anyway coming downstairs and collecting food from the gate, now even that is banned in case I accidentally spread the virus.

There needs to be some common sense. If tomorrow news comes out that some DMart employee half way across the country was infected, does that mean now that we can't go get groceries from any D-Mart? I guess its kind of a CMV. I was thinking about how cooking food requires daily interaction with local grocers for veggies and wanted to compare it with ordering food under lockdown. PS I can do both. 

1. Supposing delivery executives do 15orders a day, they get to interact with 30 different people. A grocer will be interacting daily with suppliers and customers and the count would be much higher.

2. You going to the grocer means interacting directly with a potential carrier(since they are interacting with more people). You meeting a delivery executive should be lower risk because the executive would at max be an intermediate carrier and and 2nd degree.

3. the employee was a a Box8 employee. I am not sure if they are as strict and vigilant as swiggy or zomato.

4. Ordering meat dishes will always be more nutritious than cooking eggs and veggies provided the cost is affordable.

5. The only con I can think of with delivery executives is that they will be driving to all parts of the city, even potential virus hotspots. You grocer will be in your locality. His suppliers might come from other parts but in this case grocer becomes 2nd degree. The suppliers and customers would also be almost same everyday while for delivery executives they would almost certainly be meeting different people every day.

My mind is biased towards ordering and so I wanted to get some counter arguments and whether my line of thinking is correct here. Currently I order only curry while I make rice/roti at home. This makes me order once or twice in two days. If you are ordering rice/roti/noodles your mileage will decrease both in cost and quantity.

See comments:https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g2obqh/should_i_really_be_scared_of_the_delivery/ Here only Dominos is taking orders, although with a limited menu. Swiggy and Zomato don't have many shops which are currently accepting orders. I think I'll take the risk and order dominoes pizza The biggest thing I hate about this lockdown is the very limited delivery of food online. I am semi-starving most of the time because I am too lazy to cook. 

Coz of the health hazard, I stopped buying food but I did start buying raw chicken through the liscious app and cooking them in the way i want. First we need to ask the religion of this boy and then decide whether it is deliberate attempt of spreading virus or not Drone delivery is required",Coronavirus
"Should I really be scared of the delivery executives after what happened today?  Zomato earlier said the driver delivered for them too. You need to know how your local grocery does their transactions with wholesellers. Does your grocer go to a godown, load things into a van and drive it to the retail shop? Does he get that stuff delivered? Does he or someone close to him personally  exchange cash with a wholeseller? Those things make a difference. If your grocery makes deal on the phone/online and takes deliveries through a separate loading area with no physical  interaction, then you are better off going to a grocer.

If not, delivery is safer. Delivery people usually make shorter trips since cooked food is perishable and needs to be warm on arrival. It is therefore very likely that your delivery person has just gone around within a small area of a few sq kilometers. Someone making delivery of raw/packaged food items to retail shops usually cover longer distances across several localities.

So if there is a covid-19 hotspot 10 kms away, you are more likely to get it through your grocer than through your doorstep. If you do no-contact delivery with electronic payment and basic hygiene, the risk becomes pretty low. Best option is to ask the delivery guy to leave the items outside. Maybe leave a bag. Once he leaves, leave it for a few hours. If that is not possible, take it and immediately disinfect the containers/packets using IPA/soap water/vegetable wash.

If possible, dump all the outer cartons/packaging outside your house in a garbage bin. Wash the bag in a washing machine and make sure to disinfect yourself as well after all this is done.

This is the protocol I've been following myself. We can't avoid deliveries in these times. It is far safer than going to the market and buying there where you have no control over the surroundings.",Coronavirus
"In India, do we really need Schools, parental supervision for kids after age 10, colleges for courses like Computer Engineering, jobs with less than 40 days vacation a year, Arranged Marriages, stigma against the hookup culture, and expenditure on luxury goods?

For point 3: I am guessing you have never attended college. Major purpose of college is not for someone to learn stuff, it's to build network and get exposed to various fields, make connections, get other people's perspective.

And what is wrong with buying expensive goods? People earn money by doing work and they should've full control over what they want to do with that money you're no one to ask them not to.

**When indian hr robot stops mentioning grade and college tier in requirements ?** One more thing you can't make drastic changes in a whiff. Do you think India is the same as it was in 90s? No it isn't. We progress slowly so all the social stigma and backward thinking will take time to go. It's slowly parting ways anyway. Okay I'll share with you my experience, schools,i literally hated my school,it was an environment where your opinion does not matter,i have been umder various bad conditions for logical reasoning and my parents. Mind you i didn't have acces to internet until i was 18, that's how bad my town was until i moved to Bangalore. People in my place don't care about anything, wanting to learn or try something new was frowned upon by my peers. I failed JEE, judgemental crap happened, i somehow passed entrance exam and got into a top tier shitty college. I used to think college is supposed to be good,it was literally the opposite, dickhead professors,parents don't try to understand you. Heck when i told of my problems to my parents they just told me to"" get over it"" and relayed everything to those same professors, now I'm one of the most hated students of my class, why ,coz i have a free mind with the ability to reason. The field i chose was literally worth trash,as i didn't knew coz i didn't have internet. Luckily Bangalore did. But the toll was taking on me, in the end i ended up going to a psychiatrist. For the first time i heard words of wisdom. Still my problems didn't subside, i failed a grade, my jackass friends passed. Back when i was a kid i used to think a lot about philosophies, but i considered them as useless coz i used to  open up about them to my dad, and he would shun me down. I used to think i was stupid,until one day i saw a scientist Neil degrass Tyson speak about the same stuff,that's when i thought "" I'm not crazy,it's the world that is"", but still I'm stuck in this jackass pathetic life, little context,i hate my degree from the core of my heart. And i couldn't do anything coz my father and family is paying the bills, so I'm now learning machine learning and AI to get a job and drop out of college and join some much better college with people who respect and understand me. Internet was a boon for me,but here's the reality, my father as of now still has somewhat of a control over me and my asshat professors do not leave us to do whatever we want for even a single day,human life and expectation is a joke in india. College opens the eyes of some and permanently closes the eyes of many. Hookup culture in india is pure trash,if you consider Bangalore as lax and free you're totally wrong,it would be a miracle if you hear loud music after 12. Everyone i meet has to always push their draconian agenda on someone else and control them,nobody wants a change, everyone is in a fuckin rat race and pointing fingers at others not realizing that they are degrading everyone else along with it. Hopefully i make it out of this,coz i can't withstand authoritarian bullshit with pseudo science, i don't want the next generation to face the problems like I'm facing and i definitely don't want anyone to be influenced by the of like my family or face pseudo beliefs.",AskIndia
"Weight Loss Advice  First step: stop saying I hate green vegetables. Only you can judge your ideal weight. BMI is a very inaccurate way to guess ideal weight because it doesn't consider muscle weight, fat %, bone density, etc. But still going by the norms I would say you should atleast come down to 80 kgs. And don't listen to people who say follow fruits diet, green veggies diet, herbal diet, water fast, etc. The only way you will lose weight is by caloric deficit. No matter how healthy you eat you still won't lose weight, unless your caloric intake is atleast 200-500 calories less than your daily expenditure of calories (BMR+exercise). 
And when you ask for diet plans, please mention whether you are non-veg or veg. Based on the fact that you hate veggies, I must assume you are non-veg. So I would suggest you to begin your diet journey by reducing the amount of food you are currently consuming, e.g., if you have 4 rotis take only 2, if you take 400 gms of rice take only 300 gms. Start by cutting the carbs. Cut off sugar completely, eat less starchy food. But try not to cut your protein sources like eggs, fish, meat, lentils, etc. 
And for gods sake if you are going on a diet you have to eat plenty of vegetables to ensure that your vitamin and mineral levels are optimum otherwise you might have to face severe dietary deficiencies. 
.
If you want a more detailed diet plan feel free to send a personal message. To better judge your requirements, I would need to know your current food habits, lifestyle, etc. So feel free to ask, but not in the comments. DM if you want. The regular bmi is 20.1, your BMI IS 31.4 your weight should be between 53.6-75.4kg to be considered healthy. 

Hit the gym of you can, change those food habits, try to cut down on junk food or food ie packaged. Avoid sugar, ik these things are hard all of a sudden bit start slowly. Try cutting down sugar in tea/coffee, drink water or lemonade over softdrinks and energy drinks. 


Start a workout routine at home there are plenty online. Track everything you eat/drink. My fitness pal is a good app to track , plus it tells you how much calories you need to eat per day to lose weight. You don't have to go on veggie diet to lose weight. Eat what you want as long as you don't eat above your calorie limit , you'll lose weight. Please head to r/loseit , you'll find plenty information plus people with similar goals. Cico and r/loseit worked for me. Hope it works out for you too.


P.S: Working out gives you extra calorie deficit. So just doing jumping jacks or jumping rope for half hour will definitely help. Good luck!! Search for PE with Joe on YouTube. Good to get the body moving while stuck at home. Search for ""ATHLEAN-X"" on youtube. Great videos.

Also google ""Keto diet"", I've heard it helps a lot. Try a fruit diet, I've found it to be a foolproof way to lose weight incredibly fast. Lost about 10kgs in less that 2 months. 

Combine this is with exercise, good sleep, good hydration practice and less stress.",AskIndia

"Can I buy pet supplies?  Pet stores are open around me at least. Whiskas is also available in many grocery stores so you can check that out. 


On a separate note, contrary to what you mentioned, whiskas is the opposite of ‘premium’ food. It’s a bottom of the barrel  cheap option which contains meat composites instead of actual meat; along with lots of artificial dyes and preservatives.

Wouldn’t recommend it for a Persian cat. Heads up for tails is delivering pet essentials all over India. Check out their website If you have meat shops open nearby, get chicken trimmings (neck, feet, wings, skin) and goat offal such as liver, kidneys, heart, lungs and fat, these are very reasonably priced and if you tell the butcher its for your pet he may give a discount as well and can save these cuts for you if he was throwing them away earlier.

 After thoroughly cleaning them and possibly boiling them for a short while to get rid of any bacteria you can grind them together in a mixer (with the bone material from the chicken), along with some carbohydrate such as cooked rice or sweet potato with some water, cats  can also have carrots and broccoli and spinach among other vegetables (check online), so mix those in as well.

Cats need the calcium from the chicken bones, the minerals from liver and kidney, and fats from chicken skin or goat skin. If you don't get chicken or goat skin add some sunflower oil to the slurry.  From a few kg of assorted stuff from the butcher you should be able to make 3 to 4 kg of wet cat food that can be portioned and frozen for use later. It will be more nutritious than Whiskas, and will last you a few weeks or more.

I too live in a rural area with 2 cats, but just managed to get an additional 15kg bag of their food before the lock down, so with the existing stock and the new one I am stocked for potentially 6 months, but am planning on making wet food at home over the next few weeks and introducing the cats to it gradually in case SHTF in a major way and supply chains remain broken. Pet supplies in major cities are already almost over, so I suggest you do start making stuff at home in preparation, and stock up when you can.

I understand that the first time you experienced this, it was due to a movie you watched and you are able to relate to a lot of things from other movies and animes too. Relating to the characters is a completely normal experience. However, you are feeling scared for your safety and that must not be easy at all to manage.


I would really encourage you to reach out to the number i suggested you. You will be connected to a professional psychologist there. i hope you are able to get some help.

I request this of you as it's important that  you are able to feel a little grounded in the reality around you. You mentioned having a few close friends, will it be possible to give one of them a call and share with them?  However, if you don't feel safe sharing your thoughts with them, that's completely okay. You can just ask them to talk about other things too.

Most importantly, it seems that what triggered you the most was the movie you watched and then the animes.  It's a good entertainment during these lockdown times however since it's not helping you right now and only making you more anxious and giving troubling thoughts, will you be able to limit the shows you are watching or not watch them at all? You can instead watch anything you find funny, or light on YouTube or any show or movie which is not related to a dark theme. Such animes can be really stressful for anyone.

Maharashtra apart from their major cities has really terrible roads and villages that go dozens of kilometres from these roads. There were no government buildings there but it seems like they had just recently gotten electricity (thanks to gov or whoever did that). It's a stark contrast to what I have experienced in gujarat where I have complained for roads being terrible but they were 100x better than what I experienced there. This lead to a large difference in lifestyles of villages of similar size and comparable resources. My point is, A road can change a lot. I have had a bit of comparable experience in madhya pradesh too. Maybe it was an isolated experience where I found the worse in the bunch but as they say a chain is as strong as it's weakest link.

"It is time to end the national lockdown . There is absolutely no need to extend it any further .  Lift the lockdown partially If the lockdown is ended , virus would spread rapidly , forget about deaths, just think about how much resources should be used to test,  quarantine and treat those people. If you are alive you can rebuild everything from scratch.

Im sure you are not suggesting it. Arrey Thanos ji aap yaha? RemindMe! 2 hours

P.S. Just want to see how people are gonna react to this. PK ho ka? I know this is a controversial opinion, but I totally agree with you.

Of course, the lock down can't be lifted all of a sudden, as this will cause an uncontrollable spike in new cases. But staggered relaxation of restrictions is needed. We need to think forward beyond the pandemic. Strict lock downs are causing irreparable damages to the economy, pushing it to the brink of no-return. We need to walk a tight-rope here - a balance between sealing off hotspots and stopping contamination, and allowing certain work to continue.

If this goes on for another month it is going to lead to famines in certain parts of the country. New seeds won't be planted in the farms for a timely harvest post-monsoon, hence monsoon water irrigation won't be possible. To balance this, a late planting and harvesting season would mean use of artificial irrigation and damage to the water table - something which has long term consequences.

Certain heavy industries and manufacturing plants, if left closed for long, will take a long time to get back on their feet and will need substantial financial help from the government - money that they don't have.

Infrastructure works have stopped. New roads and bridges which were being built have been stopped midway. Now if the works can't be finished before monsoons, then incomplete roads and bridges are going to be washed away, nullifying any work that has been done.

In some states, flood defense works have been stopped as well. And these need to be completed with priority before the monsoons, or we have an even worse tragedy waiting to happen.

The essential services that are still working need a better support structure, which has collapsed due to the lock down. People are stranded in mines, in oil rigs, in cargo ships and are having to continue working way beyond their scheduled rotations, because their replacements can't come due to travel restrictions. This is a disaster waiting to happen, as people working in high risk work environments need to be changed out frequently to prevent accidents caused by loss of concentration & fatigue.

The longer businesses don't operate, more the people who will lose their jobs. So we will end up with millions of peoples without jobs - this means less taxes paid, less spending power, less cash flow. Also, more jobless people means an increase in crime rate & more homeless people.

&#x200B;

In short, we are looking at a worse tragedy if we keep up with strict lock downs. >\>  I am saying this from the point of view of people who suffering a lot during the lockdown .

"Food, shelter or surveillance, LSGD gets job done  “We started off with an advantage because for the first time we had over 800 plus disaster management plans ready in local bodies. Basic works like mapping of vulnerable communities, identification of infrastructure related to health have already been done. The challenge was to co-ordinate everything on a virtual platform due to lockdown. We formed WhatsApp groups at the grassroots level especially among Kudumbashree members. All messages were promptly passed on and even as issues cropped up we were able to resolve them,’’ said Sarada Muraleedharan, principal secretary, LSGD.

The department also keeps track of grievances from shelters housing guest labourers. “We are also in the process of preparing their database for different states. We are getting queries from other states regarding their wellbeing and we have been able to answer them satisfactorily,’’ said Sarada.

A major chunk of the food packets was distributed at homes using a group of volunteers put together solely for this purpose. When there were cases of ineligible persons misusing community kitchens, LSGD gave fresh instructions to prioritize food distribution to the needy ones. A total of 44,033 lunch packets were given at Rs 20 per meal in four days till April 8 and free food was given to 1.03 lakh needy persons through Janakeeya hotels. As speculation rises over extension of lockdown, questions are raised on whether LSGD can sustain the momentum. “We are good to go. Adequate arrangements have been made for funding and we have never felt scarcity of human resource. Besides we make use of technology for data analysis which give us a clear picture of what lies ahead,’’ said Sarada.",Coronavirus

 I don't know what to say. Lock down must be lifted for ""Rural India"" with STRICT ENTRY AND EXIT checks. One thing need to be investigated.

Poor people and MGNREGA workers are saying they didn't get any fund, But govt. is coming up with huge claims. Now my problem is, if the poor people not getting fund then where is all the money is going.

Currently journalists and investigators are at minimum since they can't go out. But this need to be investigated so that we can get the full picture and proofs.  

ok, this lockdown was a good thing, has given everybody time to process and the next steps etc etc.

But why the eff would u extend it, we can't be doing this for perpetuity???! have a partial lockdown yes, i.e cinemas closed, malls, public services etc taking in less than 30% of the capacity with extended times, allowing only ppl with masks, and similar setup with offices or work from home . That would be the way to go for sure.

Not extreme lockdowns coz this virus is here to stay, and just by locking things down we ain't gonna cure it, but instead, we will destroy the economy for good, ppl will lose their jobs, food won't be available, ppl with ailments can't do anything about it, mental health and the list goes on.

so I really cant understand why the majority of randia are pro lockdown extension for perpetuity??/ have you guys thought this through or are u all sitting nice and comfy in your dads apartment or villa playing ps4 all through the day and cant really feel the heat of this extreme measure ?

at the end of the day nobody wants the cure to be worse than the disease right ?? Somehow the rich, who have decided on this lockdown, are convinced that the poor only need food and that is something we can easily manage. 

I am probably one of the least affected by this decision, but I was also born piss poor, without a functioning toilet, and this is a hard hitting decision on majority of the downtrodden in India. 

I am being called a pariah in my circle as well as a hypocrite, but this thing has not only highlighted the divide, it has bloody cemented it further. 

A lot of poor kids who will miss school are never going back. A lot of jobs will simply disappear. 

This was a selfish act of self-preservation by people - politicians who are all above a certain age and are the most susceptible to the virus, and not only poor, even MSME sector is going to feel it, if they haven't started to already.

"Questions on my mind because of the lockdown and the pandemic that’s still at large.  1. They ended their lockdown because they have aggressively screened everyone and have been virus-free domestically for weeks now. They’ll still be keeping a close eye on the situation, and screening at airports. It’s likely that they opened because they believe that the situation is contained for now. 

2. PM CARES is honestly very shady. We don’t know who benefits from it, there’s already a Prime Ministers Relief Fund for disasters which has thousands of crores still in it. We don’t know, much like electoral bonds, how this money is being spent. (https://thewire.in/government/pm-cares-covid-19-fund-narendra-modi/amp/)

3. There’s no solution for this as of yet and the government has not answered any questions regarding it. Also, for EMIs, please know that there’s interest still being collected on loans, so you may end up paying MORE if you don’t pay those EMIs. 

4. The government waited for too long to lock down the country, did it without a clear plan or message; and now the media are too busy blaming Muslims for it. People believe WhatsApp University forwards about “improved immunity”
5. HCQ drug is supposed to be useful according to some experimental trials in treating Coronavirus. Trump bullied us for it so that we’d drop the export ban. Now we might very well not have enough ourselves.
6. There’s no answer for this. We have no clear plans.
7. Essential service were not classified properly (see what happened to sanitary pad factories) and this may be a result of that. Or it maybe that people have hoarded pet food and supply chain disruption has prevented it from coming.
8. Yes. 1. The bets are on herd immunity. Second wave is generally not the same intensity as the first one. They probably think it is manageable.

2. Accountability isn't really a part of our policies. It never was either.

3. Sadly, no one knows the answers. No one knows what's to come. Support from family is likely the only savior. But people might soon realize that it doesn't take a hell lot to sustain. I am talking about the salaried class here. Not the daily wage class. 

4. People aren't going to be concerned unless it's in the neighborhood. The moment a person from your apartment complex has it, you stop going out. The best policy for a person right now is to act as if everyone has it.

5. India did send HCQ to a lot of other nations as well. Read Yuval Noah Harari's article about world during, after COVID-19. He explains why global support is absolutely necessary.

6. Reality would always be less (and delayed) than what govt. promises on paper.

7. No idea. Pet food production itself might've stifled. It's highly likely that it won't be in priority list of our government.

8. Lots of time to spend.

3. All non essential services may be shut down for next 6 months, we are in pandemic backed famine
4. Bhakts think, they can not catch corona
5. HCQ drug can NOT be taken WITHOUT prescription, it can cause HEART/KIDNEY FAILURE

Go see a doctor first. Eat a lot of rice I was super thin when I was 21-22 years old. I joined the gym and ate 4x of my appetite. I started having 6 to 7 meals a day. Eating lots of bananas and eggs helped as well. Also, drinking lots of milk. Aloo Eat in slight carolic surplus and exercise a little or else most fat you will is belly fat . Eat some banana milkshake and dry fruit as your snack You should check for diabetes, it's a possibility. Also maybe some stomach issues, maybe consult a gastroenterologist.

If there are no such problems,maybe it's just that the food you're eating has a high glycemic index (i.e it has more sugar and carbs) and quickly gets digested leaving you hungry.

I also have a similar problem of being hungry. You should have more foods with protein and fibre. Try brown rice or quinoa instead of white rice.

Also, a higher quantity of vegetables instead of rice, chapati etc. Unsaturated fat will make you feel full, while adding fat to your body. Kha ke 2 ghante so jaya kar What weight do you want to increase?... Fat or muscle? If you want to gain weight by just eating, it's going to be just fat gain.

The only way to gain muscle mass is to exercise. More specifically, lifting weights. Try eating more protein and lot of veggies and start lifting weights. Simple hai, if you eat 3 meals a day and have 2 rotis each meal, make it two and half, then 3.

Being a minority, do Muslim children get the feeling that they're different from others, and maybe face difficulty adjusting? Does this impact their mental well being - and if so, how do they get support? Do children do better when they're in a Muslim majority school or a mixed school? What are some things you feel a lot of non muslims dont know about muslims. Like, is it really religion first for most of them? From a purely academic/secular point of view, what do you think of Hinduism? I'm mainly curious to understand how Indian Muslims in general perceive the majority religion. I imagine most don't think much about it. What is the attitude of your friends/family towards the Kashmir movement? Do they support it but do not speak out because of fear? Are they nationalistic? Can you name some people (historical or present day) that Muslims look up to or consider their role models? Which exmuslim Youtubers influenced you the most? For me it's Apostate Prophet and Abdullah Sameer.",Non-Political
"I don’t think Indians are following any safety precautions properly even delivery people are no exception to this.  That is why it's paramount that you **wash your hands** every time you come in contact with anything from outside. That's literally all you can do right now, other than taking every other precaution.

"Healthcare Experts in an AMA on low count of COVID-19 cases in India  As Physician working in a corporate hospital, I'll clarify a few things as to why we are having fewer cases than expected. 
1. We are definitely testing less than other countries. 
2. The real spike is yet to be seen. We may still have a surge of cases. Too early to say that we have less cases. 
3. We don't know what the reson is for lower virulence in indians. A newly discovered mRNA in indians might be protective, as can be lower levels of ACE2. 
There are other countries like Australia as well where they have very less mortality.
4. We really are in no position to handle a situation like new york or Lombardy.

Edit. We have confirmed reports that some hospitals are hiding positive cases.

Edit 2 . The hospital has come out with a press release admitting that they indeed have 3 positive cases. However, we have known it for atleast 3 days now. They hid it from the media for atleast 3 days,  maybe more. I have a question though, Let's say India didn't have 700 but 700,000 cases in reality.

Not testing would result in low count, but you would still have sudden surge in people reporting to hospitals wouldn't you?  Or even sudden surge in deaths related to pneumonia. 

I just think that if numbers were as big as some are claiming them to be, like in the 200k to 500k range. We would've definitely seen a situation where our hospitals would be overloaded and it would've been difficult to hide that in a country like India. For those who are thinking this is not true.  
I would say just wait.

For those who are thinking we should do more tests.   
I wish India had capacity for it.

For those who want India should have done better.  
India is still a poor nation now it would be getting worse.

For those who are trying to give it a religion or political angle.  
F\*\*K YOU [removed] It has been noted and stated by many that India does lack testing facilities. And with the current situation with migrant workers, the situation can definitely worsen. It is only a matter of time! Presence of mangoes on a tree ensure that it's a mango tree. Absence of mangoes does not mean that a tree is not a mango tree. :)

Cre : Bee We're acquiring herd immunity y'all! For once, I am feeling proud for our government’s timely step. I was thinking that we might be testing less than required but today I came across this article which gave a bit of solace. 
 https://www.indiaspend.com/1-in-50-covid-19-tests-in-india-are-coming-out-positive-compared-with-1-in-4-in-italy-1-in-10-in-the-uk/

They discuss the ratio of confirmed cases to total number of tests. Quoting from the article:

India tested 25,254 samples as of 8 p.m. on March 25, of which 581 (2.3%) were positive, according to the latest update from the Indian Council of Medical Research. This proportion is comparable with South Korea's (3%) and higher than Taiwan's (1%).

In comparison, 74,386 of 324,445 tests (23%) in Italy, 6,001 of 35,995 tests (16.7%) in Austria, 65,497 of 484,062 tests (13.5%) in the US and 9,529 of 97,019 tests (10%) in the UK were positive.

More targeted testing in other countries could also be a reason for their higher percentages. [removed] Just being a negative nancy is she ^/pj",Coronavirus

1. Apart from lack of funds, why did Indiaplaza fail? I ordered many things from your website and honestly my experience was better than Snapdeal or Shopclues in the coming years. Why did Indiaplaza not become Flipkart like in scale?

2. What is your opinion about the present state of funding? i see bike rental companies which have been shut down in most parts of the world due to losses getting 100M + cheques, but startups that are making affordable energy bars struggling for bare minimum working capital. Do VCs still believe that public will be fools to accept crap shares from companies like Zomato and Yulu if they go public in 2-3 years?

3. Why is ecommerce logistics innovation lagging in India? China has working Drone deliveries by JD.com and we still struggle to deliver routine packages without damages. 

Thanks for your time. Also, what is your perspective about the stigma around failure in India? Is it true that failures are treated as pariahs inspite of their capabilities?
Also, how is your new venture performing in the face of the economic situation in India? Do you see more opportunities for products for the bottom of the pyramid population in the health drink segment. I am assuming you were into IT. How did you learn the other skills needed for running your own business? Finance, marketing, building a pitch for funding. When did you first start as an entrepreneur?

I have following questions for you.

1) Is there still room for a newbie to enter the market? I understand there are many big dogs like Amazon and Walmart out there. 

2) is it better to use e-commerce platforms like Amazon and eBay to sell. Or best to design a website, put the products on it and take care of all marketing 

3) what are your views on choosing a brand name. Does it matter? What should a brand name signify. Does it have to be somehow related to the product I'm selling? 


Forgive me my questions are very basic. 
Please reply any of these at your convenience and thanks in advance.

"Hi Reddit! I'm Srinivas Kodali, A independent researcher documenting on Aadhaar and NPR projects. Ask me Anything :)  On our request, Srinivas sent us the following text explaining the significance of NPR. I had originally added this in the announcement post. 

>The national population register is a very old project whose pilot implementation dates back to 1986 in rural rajasthan. The project came into the mainstream after the kargil war of 1999 when India realised it can't identify the foreigners from indians. During a conference of chief ministers on internal security in 2001, the project was approved. Part of the project every indian was supposed to be distributed Multi Purpose National Identity Cards, which were essentially smart card with fingerprints stored in chip. While this project was being piloted, India went through another attack on 26/11/08 in Mumbai by pakistani terrorists posing as fishermen. This is the first time cards were started being distributed to fishermen and so on.

> But post 26/11, due to the heavy intelligence failures multiple other databases like NATGRID, CCTNS, CMS, Aadhaar poppped up. Aadhaar project and NPR were very similar. So to deal with it, the cabinet combined both of them, the registar general of india became a registrar under UIDAI and started distributing Aadhaar. The deal was NPR will get biometrics from UIDAI post de-duplication, but the supreme court stopped all of this by ordering no biometrics will be shared with anyone.

>After all of this, NPR project continued and was updated part of 2011 census and again in 2015. The project in itself is the start of National Register of Citizens. NPR data will be used to disclose a list of citizens and the ones not in it will be classified as foreign residents. When data is being college for the npr, do people have to submit documents for verification? Let’s clear the elephant in the room. Is NPR as innocent as the government makes it sound? The Kerala and WB govt has stopped working on the NPR citing concerns that it will turn into NRC. Also does it actually take 8000crores to find this? What sorts of tools and software programs do you use for your research into NPR's data sets? In your opinion, will this NPR/NRC project result in gerrymandering like it happens in the US where parties draw and redraw constituency to favor the chances of their party winning ? I have two questions. 

1) How do you think the govt should balance between privacy and security? Both seem to be opposite to each other. If the govt wants to grant it's citizens some privacy (both online and offline), then that can pose a security threat as they won't be able to identify terrorists. If the govt want to tighten up the security by monitoring data (online surveillance) and putting surveillance cameras everywhere (offline surveillance), then that becomes a privacy nightmare for a citizen of a democratic country. So how should the govt balance Privacy and Security of it's citizens?

2) Related to this, what do you think about Data Protection Bill recently brought into the Parliament? It feels like the govt is focussing more on the Security aspect than Privacy (in the context I explained above). The bill was supposed to give more Privacy to citizens but it feels like the bill has gone in the opposite direction. What are your thoughts on both these questions? Thanks a lot for doing this. My questions:

1. While NPR is under citizenship act and Census under Census act, their data is being collected together. Can it be shared between the two? Is there a possibility of NPR data being used for delimitation given Census data's privacy/anonymity clause? (as you hinted this this tweet) \[ [https://twitter.com/digitaldutta/status/1209030276698931201](https://twitter.com/digitaldutta/status/1209030276698931201) \]
2. How accurate are the EC's ""voter list purification"" exercises? Do you know why do we have duplicates in voter list at all? Or is it just an excuse to delete voters who might not vote in favour?
3. Given BJP's multiple lies and delays about NRC and rules to implement CAA, what do you think they really have in mind? How should the protesters go about it all? There are women in Shaheen bagh who are sitting outside for many days now. What should we aim to do here on and how do we do it? What if I refuse to give my data?? Hola! Any plans to anthologize the years of work you have put into this? 

Amazing work safeguarding knowledge. More people need to know about that too!

Also, your knowledge of the city -- Hyderabad -- is something you should share with us ;) How can this NPR data along with Aadhar can be used for winning elections as you pointed once in your thread? Is the NPR+NRC designed in a way that people are citizens by default, unless a sarkari babu handpicks individuals and families as they wish and issues a notice to them about their ""doubtfull"" citizenship status. This way, are the majority population not harassed by the NPR-NRC exercise ? 

Are we leaving this extremely delicate problem of deciding citizenship of an entire family under the hands of these random babus (which may or may not be employed by the BJP/RSS base to target specifically the muslims?).",AMA Has Ended

"CAB Bill 2019 - News/Protests/Editorials Megathread  Please maintain decency and respect while dealing with adverse opinions. Report comments or posts you feel which goes against our rules or should not be present in discourse here. 

[**r/india Submission Rules and Guidelines**](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/wiki/rules?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf#wiki_general_guidelines) As a person from Assam, let me clear something out for you guys:

The Assamese are protesting the CAB because there are too many illegal immigrants in Assam, and they want none of them irrespective of their religion.

The left is protesting the CAB because muslims are not included in it and they want all of them to be accepted by India.

Neither congress nor BJP are actually thinking about what Assamese people want. This is the stupidest law I have ever seen or heard.How are they going to prove anyone’s religion?  What if some one comes in and becomes a Muslim? Will they lose their citizenship? 
What about persecuted athiests in every Muslim country? And why bother doing this when you are already an overpopulated country with lot of poverty and can’t care for their own population? I'm in Delhi to pick up my sister, and she's refusing to go home because there's still plenty to be done here. So I've decided to stay back and help her however I can.

Thankfully, she confirms that **no student has died** as I had previously said. The students who were assumed to have died were shot and disappeared in the chaos. They've all been found and sent to hospitals. To the redditor who pointed this out to me, I hope you forgive me for my anger. 

We're going to keep organising shelter and aid for students for the foreseeable future. For now, I have a long call with my boss and my parents to get through. Just came from a protest at Mumbai University. Atleast the Modi-Shah duo has completely lost the youth of the country. Hoping something similar from the previous generation in near future. Live from Hyderabad: Got picked up by the cops at Gandhi Bhavan metro station and bused to Moinabad Police Station. We aren't allowed to leave till 5 PM, which is after the protest at Necklace Road will end.

We've been in touch with lawyers. I hope Modi is unable to provide documents for NRC and Amit Shah uses that to usurp power and become the supreme leader. for genuine news updates follow  https://twitter.com/PTI_News

'I swear on every Biryani I've had since childhood, we are with you.' It's been a week since peasant Leader and RTI activist Akhil Gogoi has been arrested - randomly picked up while he was peacefully protesting against CAB in Jorhat district in Assam. This was before the bill was passed in the Parliament and before the fire of democratic assertion spread to the entire country. They have booked Gogoi under the horrific UAPA and handed him over to NIA and taken him to Delhi. Cameras caught him being transferred in an inhumane manner, with his hands tied behind his back when he shouted out to the reporters that he is being tortured. Today his mother has started a hunger strike demanding his release. The national media needs to show this to the people of the country. There is an undeclared national emergency in the country right now. Ritesh Deshmukh tweeted in support of the students. At least some people in the movie industry have a spine.",CAA-NRC

"Some inside information about the 'support letter' situation in Maharashtra  Is this pure speculation or these are facts., plus if Ajit was infact blackmailed, wouldn't it be easier for BJP to blackmail him to stage a NCP walk-out,during the floor test, thus reducing the halfway mark and giving BJP majority with the support of a few independents. Imo it seems Ajit pawar was tricked by dhananjay munde who was acting at behest of Sharad pawar.

Why sharad pawar is not removing him from party?? You could not be more wrong. The letter that Ajit Pawar submitted in the court today with the signature of 54 MLAs is the letter making him the Legislative Party Leader. That letter makes no mention of support to BJP. If such a letter endorsing BJP as you claim exists with BJP/Ajit Pawar then the case would be over by now.

Not to hijack the thread, but does anyone  have any experience of doing a master's in India? I'm non-Indian origin and from the United States. I'm in my mid-twenties, speak Hindi well and am planning to do a year-long language course from August onward. Hoping to do a master's in sociology or a related topic at JNU or DU before going back to the U.S. for a PhD.

I actually want to center my doctoral studies on India. TBQH I've spent several years of my life in India already. Seems like doing a master's there would help me improve my Hindi and build some bridges in academia. They have foreign student quotas, right? My undergrad cGPA is iffy, although I 4.0'd everything for my last 2.5 years as a student.

(also, the cost of doing my entire master's in India comes out to 50% of what I pay for a single semester as an undergrad here)

Again, sorry for getting a bit off topic. If you have any pertinent info, OP, I'd be happy to hear it from you (or from anyone else). Like I said, I've spent a cumulative sum of some 3-4 years in India already, so I have a good idea of what to expect in terms of conditions and education.

1. Shiv Sena opposing fish - like others have stated, Shiv Sena have never really had a stance opposing meat or beef (Correct me if I am wrong). In fact, they had flouted government orders and sold meant/fish when it was banned for Jain festivals
2.

Make sure their bosses are not complete assholes.

Doing this is far better than understanding the culture, everyone is in it for the money. >  everyone of you for all the hard work you do for american companies, but looking to understand more. Thank you! 

Not all IT guys in India work for American firms.

You can tell them about American way of exchanging pleasantries before a meeting. Or the idea of stating the facts without sugarcoating.

And, understand that factors like https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_distance are at play in the background.

 Language, accent, syntax etc is mere medium for exchanging ideas and communication. But there are things at a deeper level that cause more serious kinds of disconnected , which typically never get addressed because both parties are unaware of these things. Food is a great way to connect and just be honest about it, whether you like Indian food or not. Likewise expose them to the American cusine you think would bridge the gap Since you are American, you are rich; so please give me some American money. Like a one million money. No conversation about religion and politics. Other than those you can pretty much have any kind of conversation with an Indian. Indians are not really private people so it's fine to ask them few personal questions too, that being said what's with Americans and their reluctance to talk about which state they belong to in USA, I have met few Americans abroad who gave vague replies about which state they come from. That's something common for an Indian to ask other Indian. Well in my experience pretty much everything is alright.  


One major difficulty that Americans face while communication is the english that we tend to use. The primary reason for it is a lot of us try and translate from our native language to english and the meaning is lost in translation. I doubt it has anything to do with accent.

&#x200B;

Other than that ask questions, we love being asked about our culture and food. Also since India is a diverse beyond measure, ask them which part of India they are from and what's the specialty of that part.  


And when you feel that things might be inappropriate, just say it with ""We in America have ..... "" or ""Americans usually do ..."" which will help point out that you understand things can be different in 2 countries and most Indians would get your point or at least tell you that it is an inappropriate thing to say. >how to avoid things that are not ok to talk about as well as just general life across the planet from me

Average Indian IT guy here. I work with people from USA as well as the Indians now settled in USA every day from age 30 to 45. I have never been to USA or any other country in Americas so my opinion is might be biased.

My opinion \*starts here\*

1. Indians are in USA for good lifestyle, good money but they do miss their home back in India. We love your dollar pizza and cheap supermarkets like Costco. Indians do think to move back to India from USA, and some do, but those who stay are there for a reason.
2. Indians do not like the harsh weather in USA, specially winters.
3. Vegas, SF, and LA is on the travel bucket list of most people who moves from India to USA.
4. People from USA are smart, intelligent and courteous, atleast that is case for people on east coast & west coast. Not sure about states in central part of USA.
5. I hear about Trump from social media everyday. That guy likes to be in limelight. But seriously, whats wrong with him? On the other hand, with numerous scandals on her charts, Hillary is no saint herself.
6. People lose virginity quite early, and sex is quite common among high schoolers. But there would be fare share of exceptions as well (solely based from watching TV series).
7. I have never understood what are *Jehovah's Witnesses, Mormonism, and Scientology* but I come across these terms often.
8. USA (in some cases, CIA) is responsible for some really fucked up shit around the world, I'm talking Cuba, Nicaragua, Guatemala, Vietnam, Afghanistan to name some. Honestly, USA should stay away from politics of other countries, which is a nice way of saying stop invading other countries.
9. Invading Area 51, Burning Man, lots of national parks, open mindedness, culture and people of USA is lit.
10. Drug problem is serious in some states of USA. And I'm not talking about Marijuana.

\*ends here\*

I haven't had any trouble working with Americans in over a decade, infact I prefer Americans over most other nationalities when it comes to work because you make it a point to have a life outside the office which means I dont have to either.

I do however hate working with people of Indian/Asian origin in the US because they somehow embrace all the negative stereotypes of Americans more than the rest of you.

"AMA Request: A Kashmiri Pandit over 30 years old.  I know one but he's 20. I'll try to contact his father. One of my closest school friends is KP, but I don't think he's on Reddit

His entire family is very happy about the decision of course My ex gf was, but eh, we don't talk any more. Got another opinion from a friend: 

""Answering as Kashmiri Pandit (KP) born in 1990, we lost our home, business, identity, culture, health and became refugee in our own country. No amount of  compensation can make KPs to go back because of one simple reason we lost trust in other community. My generation has heard and read horror stories of migration and how our kashmiri brothers watched while we were butchered. We don't know what future holds but exodus of my community will always be darkest chapter in the history of Kashmir. I dont know about others but I wont be able to ever go back. Its not to the point and emotions get in the way. Getting government assigned flats and houses is a good deal but it doesn't change the fact we lost our heritage and culture.""

Also he suggested you google Girja tickoo and Satish tickoo and read ""Our moon has blood clots"" Kashmiri here, however, under 30.  
I will try to get someone to get your questions answered. I asked someone who is Kashmiri and above 30 years. Below is  his view :

""I  think everyone has his view point. One has to answer these questions today or tomorrow as these are the relevant questions. We still do not understand our position yet and what government of India has decided for us. Are we still migrants or that tag has been removed from us ? The situation says wait and watch."" Ama request. Rahul Pandita. KP was old enough to understand what was going on in 90s and Young enough to say us his opinions. RemindMe! 1 day Can we get anupam kher to do an ama? I'm 26 and from the Kashmiri Pandit community. Given my age, I agree that I'm not in the best position to answer OP's questions but I can take a stab if they're still interested. But below are some general thoughts if anyone's interested:

My parents were forced to leave Kashmir in 1989-90 and move to a place at the other end of the country where I grew up. They haven't been back since - just briefly for a week on vacation to show me what it's like about 15 years ago. And it's sad and terrible. But, it's possible to recognize the plight of Kashmiri Hindus that had their lives uprooted overnight 30 years ago while also recognizing that what's happening right now is upsetting, undemocratic and unconstitutional. 

Unfortunately, Indians (and the KP community to a large degree) has been consumed by bloodlust and it's fucking saddening. What's worse - and I find bewildering - is how none from the KP community were in support of repealing 370 until Modi showed up in 2014 and they realized this would be a way to unleash a fresh hell in Kashmir under the garb of ""patriotism"" and ""unification"" (perhaps I'm projecting too much malice on to their intentions when I should chalk it up to stupidity and propaganda). I don't think the community itself stands to gain a lot from this. 

The most honest analysis is that historically, a lot of parties - including those suffering the most today - fucked up but no one took ownership then and now it's just spiraled out of control after how oppressive the Indian government has been there. You expect States to be reasonable actors in these situations and not stoop to the level of terrorists because either way, it's the common person who's affected the most. And, as things stand today, while the Kashmiri Hindus have been rehabilitated elsewhere to a reasonable degree, more than two generations of Kashmiris who stayed in Kashmir (primarily Muslims and Sikh) grew up in the world's most militarized zone. I'm extremely pessimistic about the situation. I am quite certain that we're living through the creation of another West Bank here. I am a Kashmiri Pandit, I turn 30 in a few months. I know many Kashmir Pandits over 30, including my parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles.

1. I am of the opinion that Kashmir will be violent in the short term. Extremist violence is common in Kashmir, why should this situation be any different?
2. We will never return to Kashmir, outside of the occasional very short trip. I have been to Kashmir once in my life, despite my father begging me not to go, for my safety. I had to see the place that haunts my entire family, at least once. My father has been back once since the 1980s. The handful of elderly relatives that remained are slowly dying off. 
3. Our ancestral house was sold under duress while my family was in exile. Our neighbors are the onces who forced us to sell, under threat of violence. The bones still exist, but it was turned into a shopping mall. We won't return because we'll never feel safe. 
4. My family was not provided housing by the government of India. We were privileged enough to pay for our own housing. Many family members settled in the Delhi area and have done well for themselves since. Some family members  have moved to the US, Dubai, Singapore and elsewhere and have also done quite well for themselves. I know that my family is not the kind of Pandit you're asking the question about, but it is true that the Kashmiri diaspora has very little incentive to come back as they have rather good lives outside of Kashmir. Of course, those who are still refugees are different, but come on - Kashmri Pandits who have a modicum of success aren't moving back to a remote valley with poor infrastructure and a majority of inhabitants that could want us dead at any moment. 
5. Yes. The reservation was an ill-intentioned policy that failed Kashmiris and prevented the proper integration of Kashmir with India.

I am by no means a Hindu nationalist and I think the Indian government deserves plenty of blame for the situation in Kashmir as well as the plight of Kashmiri Pandits (as does the Pakistini government, and Kashmiri Muslims).

Frankly, I think Kashmiri Pandits are beside the point in this discussion, because Kashmiri Muslims succeeded in exterminating our culture. Without anchoring to the homeland, there aren't enough of us to carry it forward and those numbers continue to dwindle as we marry non-Kashmiris. In a generation or two, Kashmiri Pandits will cease to exist in any meaningful way and no policy will save that so policy making shouldn't consider ""our plight""

> ""I would like you to imagine a national coin-flipping contest. Let’s assume we get 225 million Americans up tomorrow morning and we ask them all to wager a dollar. They go out in the morning at sunrise, and they all call the flip of a coin. If they call correctly, they win a dollar from those who called wrong. Each day the losers drop out, and on the subsequent day the stakes build as all previous winnings are put on the line.

In the Netherlands (where I am from) it is considered very weird to do an MBA without having at least around 4-5 years of work experience. Combined with the fact that most people enter the workforce here at a later age as well results in most people taking their MBA while being in their late 20s/early 30s.

"India's first indigenous processor developed at IIT Bombay. I am a designer AMA!!  Well done OP, but honestly you should have shared more details.

> [Welcome AJIT, a ‘Made in India’ Microprocessor](
https://researchmatters.in/news/welcome-ajit-‘made-india’-microprocessor) 

> Prof. Madhav Desai and his team of about nine researchers from IIT Bombay have designed and developed the processor entirely at the institute. The project was funded by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY)  and IIT Bombay. Powai Labs, a Mumbai-based company, has also invested in the venture and will own, market and support the product. 

> AJIT’s features can be compared to many of the microprocessors of its size available in today’s market. Unlike the ones used in the desktops like the Intel’s Xeon, AJIT is a medium-sized processor. It can be used inside a set-top box, as a control panel for automation systems, in a traffic light controller or even robotic systems. What’s more, the researchers expect that AJIT will cost as less as ₹100 when it is produced en-masse. 

> AJIT can run one instruction per clock cycle and can operate at clock speeds between 70-120MHz, comparable to its competitors in the market.

> “We have been working on this processor design for more than two years now. The design has been tested on programmable semiconductor chips before we began our effort towards fabricating the processor,” says Prof. Desai

> The researchers have made the software tools associated with AJIT freely available to everyone. The processor is also available as a ‘softcore’, where vendors can buy a license to use the design of the microprocessor and fabricate it to use it in their system. The researchers also offer to customise the processor for specific applications.

2) Any advice for improving English?

3) Can you recommend me any websites or magazines that is good for current affairs and gk?

4) What was your strategy to memorise all this huge gk and current affairs?

5) How many hours did you allot for studies? Do you recommend studying late night?

[deleted] Delhi continues to suffer from severe air and water pollution which is affecting livability of the city and the health of its residents. What measures is AAP prepared to implement (even if politically difficult) to improve the situation long-term and what actions can have the most immediate impact? Why you (AAP) want to form a alliance kind of thing with Congress and not trust your own basic self? You have done good work in Delhi and even if the social media and media doesn't show it, people of Delhi know. 1)Last year Kejriwal government announced Free Tirth Yatra for senior citizens. Do you think this is the right use of tax money or an opportunistic and desperate measure to gain votes?

&#x200B;

2) Several prominent leaders close to Arvind Kejriwal have left AAP. Do you think it is because Kejriwal has become dictatorial? Does this mean AAP is going on a path like other parties where party is controlled by an individual/family? Do you think party has succumbed to the issues of the same politics that it had sought to fight?

&#x200B;

3) Kejriwal has maintained in his earlier speeches that he will never form an alliance with any party, but he is now looking to form an alliance with Congress to defeat BJP in Delhi. If AAP is different from others, shouldn't it be focusing on delivering work which will speak for itself in the elections, instead of focusing on defeating another party?

Why is AAP so desperate to grab the hands of those very people they were pointing fingers at during the Scam movement? What happened to those bold statements made by Kejriwal?

edit: added another question and removed the word ""lagbhag"" in a hope to get some answers.
 How many of AAP are active on Reddit? Does AK also follows discussion here? What AAP is doing in terms of connecting with educated fellas. Earlier it used to be passion for them.  Then came the AAP in power,  for lot of time it became a laughing matter if someone said he follows AAP or Kejriwal. Most recently things are getting better as people can see work done in education and health.

My point being,  elections are mostly battle of perception than proof of what's done or not done. What you people are doing to improve on perception front ? Does AAP support the idea of political parties under RTI? If Yes, then what have you done about it as of now?",AMA is over

Any instances where you've felt lonely? How did you deal with it?  Hum kaale hain toh kya hua, apna time ayega Get an escort ? There shouldn’t be any taboo since we are all spending money for company, in one way or another  One of my earlier rejection stories:

After finishing engineering, I had to be at home for almost 2.5 years before I got the offer letter. Almost everyone who got hired with me, had their jobs delayed. (This was like 15 years back).

Anyways, I was really excited about the job and I was in training where I saw this beautiful lady in the same class. I had this instant crush, but no balls to walk up to her to talk. I did not really know it was called as 'dating', but you would just ask them for coffee at CCD and it meant that only. Or you would write a letter and give them. 

So, training was for 3 months and 2.5 months had already passed. Once training is done, you can be posted anywhere. Also, back then I used to be enthusiastic at trying atleast lol. 

At that day when the class finished, I walked behind her and said 'excuse me'. Which she didn't hear (or pretended to not to hear). I had to repeat and shout a little, when she stopped. She looked back and making an annoyed expression of what do you want. At this point, mera poora phat gaya tha. For couple of seconds, I didn't know what to say. I stammered and said something like do you want to have coffee. She got so angry and threw her water bottle at me. I have no idea why she did that. Then she said, do you even know who I am etc etc and asked me to get lost. 

That's it. Next two days, I avoided my training classes (which were mandatory). Later, training finished and I never saw her again.

can share more, but my comments are not appearing. Did you ever take any steps to improve yourself to better sell yourself or put yourself out there? why didnt you do a quick bangkok trip? Dude, I feel for you. I'm just like you too. **M, 33, textbook virgin.** Never hand held any girl. Kissing a girl is in my bucket list. Have been too coward, poor and clueless to afford high class (safe) hooker. My parents have given up on me long ago and all my younger siblings are married now.  What's the point of having an AMA if you don't answer any of the questions?  I think you should get a dog for now. Who knows what the future might hold. Maybe the good boi could become your wingman. It's ok dude. Marriage is not everything in your life. Save enough for your retirement and have emergency funds. Focus on increasing your networth and enjoy your bachelorhood.  Am posting this without reading any of the other comments. There's two options you got:

1. If you MUST, find someone who NOBODY else wants to marry. A nice human being who would appreciate you for who you are. A widow or a differently abled person. And you may find love. 
2. Focus on your career and making, saving, and investing as much money as you can. And health of course. Then fuck bitches and whores (budget for it). 

The second option is my recommendation. Relationships are overrated; dont get into one and for fucks sake dont make little people. Fuck that shit; live for yourself. 

Building great friendships is more satisfying and fulfilling than chasing shitty ass romantic relationships. 

And learn to rock that shit; not everybody is handsome and attractive... with the right attitude, you can make ugly awesome! I would rather have an ugly but awesome friend than hang out with a handsome looking asshole.

"Namaste, India! You might remember me from my ""I'm a Pakistani"" AMA here 7 months ago! Can we talk about war?  It warms my heart to see your kind message.

People from both counties need to not respond to hate with hate. This doesn't mean that either side becomes a doormat. Definitely not. But I find it sad to see people take pride in the attack or retaliation. The loss of life is never something to take pride in or rejoice for.

I think it is important for us Indians to keep in mind that the terrible attack was by terrorists and extremists and not every Pakistani. That most of the people of Pakistan condemn the act. For this, it would help if Pakistanis could openly vocally condemn too. 

It will really help matters if there is interaction between our communities. A lot of the distrust is out of ignorance, out of just not knowing better. It is understandable given our histories and excusable if it hasn't done genuine harm. People have been fed incorrect data on the other nation and nothing but more awareness, more truth can fix this. 

Most importantly, I would like to mention is that I'm Indian and we say dabba at home. I did not go through the previous AMA so if it was acknowledged that some Indians do say dabba and dibba is just much more common then forgive me for bringing it up again. 

Edit: I realize I haven't asked a question here but I am looking to discuss ways to control the situation. Also I did want to ask about how it's portrayed by Pakistani news but someone already did.  Im scared. I have no clue how any of this is going to play out, I hope to god that this is just for the election and both sides will de escalate soon but I'm honestly worried I Might get drafted.maybe I'm paranoid, but we're talking about a possible nuclear war. What scares me most is how Indians seem to be reacting to the new if the strikes. I don't understand how people can be celebrating sending a missile into another country. Yeah sure it was terror camps, but we shouldn't celebrate that. We should do it with reluctance. War is the last refuge of the incompetent. It shouldn't be worshipped. I was talking to one of my friends last night and as she was going she said ""main sone chali neend mein thode Pakistani maarne hai"" 

I was shocked and offended so badly how someone so young ( I'm 19 she's 18 ) can have some much hatred. I get the anger that Pakistan **might** house terrorists and it's a matter of concern for both of the countries. Later on I ended up arguing and saying that people like her is why war comes into the picture.

But I see so many people with so much hatred towards innocent people who just have no hatred towards our country. It makes me feel sad. 

I'm grateful there people like you who try to resolve and talk things rationally instead of going berserk and spreading hate.

I've seen enough documentaries and talked to enough American war veterans to know how bad and traumatic war is. I'd never wish Something like this upon any of the countries.

I just hope all of this ends soon and no more lives are lost. 

Thank you for your efforts. Peace.  Elections are coming, they will end and so will all the chaos. day by day I am becoming a big fan of reddit in this time of tension its heartening to see a discussion happening rather than abusing each other. I am not in FB as its extremely toxic and in twitter also people are baying for each other’s blood. war is a lose lose situation for both the countries, hope pakistani army will follow the geneva convention and send our brave pilot safe and sound and peace will prevail again. Whatever this is, this is made to look as an immediate response to a heinous attack on Indian soil through terror camps based out of Pakistan. It is a show of power, and it is something that has deep political implications because the elections are coming. The only big news is that munitions were actually dropped in another country. Indian jets have crossed Pakistani airspace for a while now but it was for surveillance only.  

This show of force isn't going to do anything because in the end the ISI/Military will be do what they have always done, send terrorists in with their blessings. Your governments have always been a puppet of the ISI. The utter humiliation of 1971 is not something anyone in the military has forgotten, nor will they ever forget. And Kashmir is just a playground for the proxy war and that is about it. In the end, the citizens will suffer. Both sides of the border. And jingoism will continue. In the end let us all agree that mutton biriyani is the best, and veg biriyani should be nuked.

Also, this is just a suggestion, when I see 'diamond/ titanium' being used to describe a cheap product (cheap as in price, not utility), I tend to become wary and do 10x research before buying it. I would suggest backing up your claims or using an alternate description. kudos you still beat people like me, who have ideas only to exist in head. https://www.amazon.in/dp/B07KN95BJ5?ref=myi_title_dp

http://www.vcattools.com/

https://youtu.be/B26xJxVm3z8

https://twitter.com/VCATTools In my opinion, the biggest trouble for you is the price. The number of people looking for such a product is less in India. And, among such people, most people will just go to the cheaper alternatives especially since they can see those alternatives right under your product's Amazon page. Why would the price conscious people choose your product which is 3 to 5 times more expensive than the other alternatives?

IF I was looking to buy your product, this is what I would do.

1. Check it online in Amazon and Flipkart(plus offline stores if it is something which is only available offline).
2. Compare the features and price of the products listed there.
3. Choose the most value for money product with the features I want.
4. See if it is Amazon Fulfilled or Flipkart assured.
5. If it is not, then check the price of the next alternative and see which one is fulfilled.

Also, your product is an ""insurance"" device whose use comes many many years after the purchase IF the user meets with a serious accident. Most people in India don't even understand that there is a risk of seatbelts getting jammed. I have a lot of friends who are Automobile fans who talk about each and everything about cars and bikes. We discussed safety issues as well but never have we discussed seat belt getting stuck. We have discussed the need for breaking the glass though.

So, your target users are firstly not aware of this issue and secondly, since they are buying an insurance device, they will look to have maximum features in that one tool like a swiss army knife because they will be imagining all sort of disastrous accidents. Like the user below mentioned about his device having a torch/blinker. They will not realize the negative side of that torch device being nowhere in their reachable vicinity when they meet with such an accident, thus making it pointless to have that device in the first place. Like, if you are having such a huge collision, then this torch can get thrown around the place, or it can become unreachable. And, they may never even be able to use the torch because its battery will be dead long ago.

But, however, they are not thinking about these things while making this insurance purchase. They are looking for max features for least price. An all in one tool often wins in this case especially if it is cheaply priced.

I had seen your original post and had all these thoughts in my mind at that time as well. Anyways, good luck. I hope your next product succeeds. Oftentimes, the first product from new entrepreneurs ends up in such situations, but later products have better chances of success as now you know all these things. We need people like you creating new stuff like this. Good luck.  Cool I have a car emergency tool always in my car which was like ₹200 back in the day. It features include:

- flashlight
- emergency beacon
- magnetic base to stick to the side or roof of the car
- pointed hammer to break glass
- seatbelt cutter tool.

My question is - 
Most of the problems plaguing the country at this point, be it education/public health/climate are systemic in nature. Successfully solving these problems, that too with a consulting toolkit can be a very hard task. For those of us who’re young, inexperienced and want to carry out such projects without deep knowledge of how tangled they are, what suggestions would you offer? 

Also, other than HIV, what according to you is the other big problems that we all should be working toward? Signing off for now!
Thanks for all those questions, and I'm on twitter at alexander_ashok.
If you have more questions ...well read the book :)

My book is not so much about HIV and many of the  questions are …
Its about the power of communities of the most marginalized women to solve huge problems..there's a revolution hidden in that

Its also about a personal journey, the adventure within us, waiting to be had...

its about another India, shocking and also inspiring we never see..

i'd welcome questions on those lines too... I’ve heard from my friends who’re at MBBs that it’s not a cakewalk, you must have worked really hard to be there in the first place and to survive and grow as well. How challenging is it for a person like you to run an NGO like The Antara Foundation and work at the grassroots level in a sector like healthcare? What were the difficulties faced and what was/is the motivation to keep going? Hi Ashok, /u/struggle_r asked the following questions --

>     
> 2. If you were given an opportunity to address one problem in Indian society, what would that be? Despite progress and change in social attitudes towards HIV/AIDS, there is yet a lot of stigma that surrounds this health issue. Based on your Avahan experience, what solution would you offer to break this taboo?  What's your view on the recent Trafficking Bill being introduced? Is there any truth in reports claiming that it might end up [targeting sex workers?](https://qz.com/india/1499242/indias-proposed-anti-trafficking-law-may-hurt-sex-workers/) Hi, thanks for taking out the time for doing this.

How would you rate the current situation that we as a country (and the healthcare sector) are at when it comes to tackling the societal aspect of the disease and the taboos associated with it? I believe there is a tremendous amount of work that PSM (preventive and social medicine) can do to make things even better especially when it comes to reaching out to the sex workers and providing them with better support.

In past, I had tried to work with AAP, but was unsuccessful at it because of lack of structure. We would love to have you India's HRD Minister. If AAP pushes your name as HRD minister - you might actually get support from other parties and wider constituents. Best of luck for Lok Sabha elections. Hi! Thank you so much for doing this AMA. My questions are more tied to your education work.

1. How do you feel about the role of organisations like Teach For India that exist outside of the public education system but seek to supplement it? There's an argument that they help fill in certain gaps and improve individual schools/aid in teacher improvement, but there's also the counter argument that they devalue actual teachers, so any thoughts would be great!

2. A lot of the changes that have happened in Delhi seem to have involved adopting best practices from other countries and from the existing body of education research. How difficult has it been adapting what works outside the country to what works within the state?

3. There aren't too many centres focusing on education research in India outside of APU, JNU, and TISS (off the top of my head). How problematic is that to localising education research?

1. Do you think there is a concerted effort to rewrite the history of our country? Do you think that the present uni dimensional nature of professional education is much to blame for the social dystopia whatsapp forwards have created by citing fake history, fake polity and even well educated people are falling prey to it?

2. Do you think that the present governments stance of pushing privatisation of education, and pushing every institution to be self dependent will ultimately spell disaster for the middle class and lower class, who will fail to take up such courses?

3. The Indian growth has been a curious case of jobless growth. What opinion do you have on the fact that although the private sector has boomed since 1991, we have failed to create sufficient jobs? In the same context, should the government be relieved of all responsibility regarding job creation, or do you believe the present govt just wants to shrug off its share of responsibility ?

4. An economy without planning is more often a directionless economy. While NITI aayog was developed in the first place to allow pvt participation in govt decisions, it has now turned out to be a body of paid ""yes men"" who merely provide rubber stamp on what the govt believes. What's your take on this, what do you think is better, the Planning commission or the present model of niti?

Kudos for all your good work. Will wait for a reply! Dear Atishi,

I write to you as a frustrated citizen today and not to discuss AAP's work in Delhi or AAP's plans. I know this is an AMA, but I write this with the hope that you and your party workers will read this, and respond if I am lucky.

This nation seems to be falling apart each day with a new low in operating as a democracy: posts against netas gets you jailed, mobs can kill you and not face legal repercussion, and laws seem to be making dirty politics even more powerful and easier to crush dissent. As recent as today morning multiple law agencies were given the full freedom to track anybody on the internet and take action without specifying a reason.

History has proved that duopoly of Congress & BJP netas wouldn't care for anything but to further their respective position and agenda. Both parties can be considered guilty of introducing measures to further weaken democracy. Not just that, they have succeeded through their legions of ""IT Cell"" trolls to turn people against themselves, actively attacking anti-ruling party sentiment and rooting for measures which are more fascist than democratic in nature.

When AAP rose from the national fire around the Jan Lokpal bill and the protests, I as well as many of us had high hopes from you. But it seems that AAP is, to be honest, in a weaker position to combat this neta duopoly ruling over the nation. Call it ""a conspiracy against Mr Kejriwal by parties"", national opinion is still keeping you guys on the backburner.

Having said that, I think you guys are still fighting the good fight. Delhi's progress in the education system is phenomenal and electricity pricing, as well as the e-delivery of services are huge steps forward. Your struggle with the former Lt. Governor as well as regarding Delhi Police - I can understand why you took them head on. 

Elections are just around the corner. I am someone who is genuinely afraid that our nation, which should be all guns blazing towards progress, will fall into the dark ages with the political game getting nastier by the day. You guys are relatively much better than most national and regional parties in terms of being scot-free. If anything, AAP must concert their efforts like there's no tomorrow and ensure that voter sentiments shift away from the two horrible choices that Indian voters are stuck with.

I, and hopefully quite some of us, are still counting on you and your party. Please give us an option we can choose for once. We need one. Badly now than ever. How can the unemployed people on reddit help your party? You should also teach people that getting water upto 20kL for free and electricity upto 400 units at half rate isn't known as freebie.

"Hi, I'm Milan Vaishnav and you can Ask Me Anything beginning at 9 am EST/7:30 pm IST  Hi Milan, thanks so much for When Crime Pays! It inspired us to make [this episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tN0iyfob8-U) on our YouTube Channel.

A key aspect of removing crime from politics could be campaign funding reform. How do you think we can realistically  achieve a more transparent campaign finance laws? Would it be fair to say that the present day India is same as the Gilded Age America? Do you think the Indian institutions (RBI, CAG, CVC, CBI, etc) are heavily influenced by political agents? If yes, what can be done to limit the political influence in administrative institutions?  Hi Milan, What is your opinion on bringing private sector talent in Bureaucracy considering conflict of interest, revolving door policy and nepotism.  Hi, what all books do you recommend as your favourites. About India, contemporary politics, world as well as fiction. I have read few chapters from When Crime Pays and found it really interesting, thank you.  I have another question, if you would indulge me, and I understand this is probably not fit for an online AMA.

Do you agree that the emergence (resurgence?) of militant (and super combative+populist) right wing is a pattern that is being observed throughout the major democracies of the world? I understand that each democracy is unique but is there an underlying commonality between these elections? Is this a new world order? Is this the last wave of populist nationalism before ideas such as egalitarianism become mainstream?  Hi Milan, welcome to /r/India. To what extent do you think,  think tanks affect policy making. In your experience, do bureaucrats stay updated with the latest literature?   Its a fatalistic/question out of desperation: will the system of politics, money laundering for elections, crime in politics... Will this ever change? (Deep down I think I know the answer and its not the happy one) What has the reaction to the book ""When Crime Pays"" been in India? Has anything changed since then? Does crime still pay in Indian politics? Are you able to go to India without risking being jailed or personally injured? Do you vote in Indian elections? What do you think of Jason Brennan's book ""Against Democracy""? Hi Milan, thanks for the AMA!

We’re seeing a lot of fake news being used in the state election campaigns these days (mainly but not exclusively by the BJP) to influence voters emotionally. Now appealing to emotions is understandable, but what do you think is the role of third-party regulation (if any)? Can the Election Commission impose some sort of penalty on political parties for this? If not, what can be done to curb fake news in campaigning - especially since a lot of what is spoken in smaller rallies in neglected areas doesn’t make it to the news?

I see a lot of people making up their opinions on whom to vote for based on what one politician said about another which is usually nothing but an absurd claim. Hi Milan, is there an estimate of sentiment for or against the current ruling dispensation from the non organized sector?

"Hi, I'm Hari, Co-founder of Pickyourtrail - AMA  a stupid question:

how is your service better/different from thomas cook/SOTC/Balmer&Laurie ? How many times were you close to bankruptcy? When you are bootstrapped how do you decide salary for founders? Saw your website and really liked the interface. tried planning a Euro trip and my questions are based on that relative experience:

1. Am I right in saying that your website does not sell pre -packaged travel packages rather it gives the user an option to select from within the pre-selected vendor options to ""customise"" their tour? So essentially you are a marketplace of vendors with a travel layer on top to facilitate bookings?
2. Your website helps customise an itinerary but optimising the itinerary is still missing anything you are doing to fix that?
3. I tried creating an account but your website seems content to let me plan without creating an account which is good but created an itinerary and wanted to save it by logging in and couldn't do that?
4. If i directly get in touch with your travel experts to help me create an itinerary will they charge me for that..sorry didn't find that info anywhere? 1. What was your toughest customer service experience?


2. What about backpacking options when visiting a country? For example, exploring areas that are not touristy or somewhat secluded.


3. What are your views on legalizing marijuana in India? Would it change tourism sector in any way and would it change your list of offerings?

4. Let's say a tourist is caught for some illegal activity or a tourist loses their passport. How do you handle such unforeseen circumstances? I am very impressed with the website so I decided to see how it works and looked for Newzeland as an option. And next day onwards I am being called by your representative. I received already 3 calls 1 sms and 1 email.  Hello,
As someone who has used this service, I have had a mixed experience. It's a really nice concept to choose the activities and opt out of the things which doesn't seem to interest the individual.
We have had hiccups during the trip planning and the trip. These could have been better - especially the communication with the overseas partners as well as the visa agents and the ones from PYT who was managing our trip (this was resolved after escalations and the agent was changed) 

Also someone was supposed to get back to me regarding an issue but then forgot to, as this was post the vacation. I would have had a better opinion if the person followed through on this than leaving it.

Anyways, my first international vacation was through you guys and I will always remember the good and the bad.

"I invented a safety device. Please share your views and support us if you can  I came in feeling quite sceptical, but I think its a really cool idea! I am your target market: someone with a car who is safety conscious, has a dashcam and those hammer-cutters. They *are* quite large and not easily accessible because I keep them in the glove compartment. I have often wondered how difficult would it be to reach for them in an emergency.

I think the biggest problem you will face are the Chinese knockoffs that will flood the market soon, irrespective of the patent. So you need a stronger branding which people recall easily, conveys high quality and can differentiate from those knockoffs. Something that implies the importance of these, like ""VCAT *Lifesaver* V1"". Because then customers can be assured that yours is the real deal, which is original and better quality. I am guessing this is a prototype, but put some good branding right in the middle that reminds that this is the original one.

Try and promote it to motorbeam and other famous Indian automobile you tubers etc. u/cooltechpec I really like your enthusiasm, but point made by u/kash_if are not wrong. I know how you feel, when you put lots of effort in product building, and after launch receiving criticism and competition. You have made the same, mistake that lots of entrepreneurs make. Developing product without doing any market research.

Here's are some problem I see:-

- ""resqme"" cost 10 $ in US that's less then what you are selling at right now.

- Their product is far better in design department. 

- If your market is India, where people already don't care about the safety you are already at loss. 


Here's are some options for you, if you want to make money:-

- Sell the patent to company, who is already making this kind of devices. (or collect the royalty for it)

- Start selling the product in bulk to people who sell ""Emergency kit"" for automobiles.

- Western market is the best for this kind of product. (Cause forget about getting 1k from Indian Unkill who will not even do PUC to save 50rs)


Last advice: Don't hang on this product, too much if it doesn't workout. You have already learn about process. Take the knowledge and use it in new ideas. 

Edit:Formatting My suggestions:

1. Give it a real appealing name. VCAT sounds like an acronym. But come up with a name to it. Like ""LifeSaverPro"" or ""CarGenie"" or something else that is much more catchy.
2. Add a video to your amazon page.
3. Write a real clean description in your amazon page. If you are not equipped enough, hire someone who can write it for you.
4. Add a trailer sort of video too to your page. Have someone talk in the video. shoot a video that looks authentic, professional and then upload that.
5. PLEASE HAVE A WEBSITE!!! This is essential when you want to ask for reliability.
6. Those amazon reviews that are already there doesn't seem to be authentic. Looks like you or your friends wrote those.
7. Try to get some certifications like ISO etc., 

Love your product as such. If you are searching for investors let me know. Couple of questions: Why is it 1000 bucks? Is it because of the diamond? Is there no other cheaper alternative to that? I mean, I understand this is going to save my life someday, but it's not a omnipresent product yet.

Secondly, one thing that would stop me from buying is my concern about how it will feel if I have this chunk of plastic rubbing against my body all times I am driving. I'll need instructional videos to see if I can remove it during long drives (I know, it's counterintuitive) or at least when it's getting too itchy. I don't want to cut my seatbelt away trying to remove it while on the wheels. 

PS: Knowing this sub, I expect someone to advise me on how I am stupid to want to remove it when driving. But that's your average customer.  Is this safe, a metal & plastic device just on the centre of the belt. It could harmful in an crash to your body as it can damage your heart.  My feedback

* Video is abrupt, Put a complete video if installation
* Post on team-bhp 
* Post in r/cars
* Look for retailers in the west, can find traction there
 Is there some certification you need to get for automobile accessories?
 
Get a trademark and apply for patent.

Start shopping it around to OEM or some reputed third party resellers. Go to auto spare parts markets in your city and see if you can get shopkeepers to stock your product. 

I don't think selling them one at a time online is worth your time.

Get somebody like Auto Car or somebody else to cover your product. If not that, run ads in all Auto Magazines now. The idea sounds pretty good. I have a few questions though.

1. Do you have a website for your startup?
2. How are you able to provide diamond anything for 999?
3. How does one person provide lifetime customer support?
4. Are you sure the Chinese replicators won't be able to disassemble your product and make knockoffs?

Can you tell me more about your development program in a PM? I may not be able to help you since I'm a CS student but I know people who might be interested.  This is a really nice product and would definitely consider buying it but I didn't understand what happens when it gets pulled out by mistake?

* By liberalism, do you mean to implement classical liberalism by definition, e.g. a very limited state with rest of the work left to the citizens. Or do you mean a welfare state, with medium to high taxes, basic welfare cover to the citizens and government financing some services like education health etc but a free market at its core. If its the former, and since the Nordic Model has worked quite well, how do you plan to convince people that your idea is better, especially when India has still millions to lift from poverty. 

* Where do you stand on public healthcare (I went over the document and couldn't find much mention of it). Even the most free market economies like Singapore, Korea (South) have some amount of healthcare funded by government public funds. Do you support that?

* Totally free market economy haven't been yet implemented in countries with scale of India (even if we take China, they rarely support free trade, so I don't think they can be called 100% free market). The most liberal economies are small or city states - Singapore, Hong Kong, Korea (south) and the Scandinavian countries. How do you think you will implement free market reforms in billion strong India scale?

* Do you support de-federalization of government functions, a new mostly conservative idea, i.e., most of the government should be implemented at lower levels (panchayat, municipality, district, state etc) and the federal government should be left with only a few functions - national security, external affairs etc. 

* I see you support free speech and free press, how do you plan to deal with fake news which even big media houses have fallen prey to. Should there be any repercussion/legal action if a media house spreads fake news?

* Lastly, I see you support secularism. Do you think secularism and freedom of religion can go together? Should citizens be allowed to mock/criticize religion(s) without any limits, since that falls in your definition of free speech. How do you plan to deal with such speech causing riots? ",AMA

Natural evolution of the hCoV-19 virus, April 13, 2020

GISAID Comments on the Discussion of Different Types or Clades of the hCoV-19 Virus and their Origin

As the outbreak evolves over time and more data becomes available, several colleagues have analyzed and proposed different ""types"" of the virus and their origin. Depending on choice of definitions one can classify the circulating virus strains into a different number of clades based on genetic variants. These are part of the natural evolution of the virus currently not known to be associated with any differences in virulence. 

Changes in prevalence of these variants in the short term are expected and often driven by chance or so-called founder effects rather than immediate evolutionary pressure. GISAID's daily summaries of strains distinguishes clades based on genetic marker variants but this is subject to change following the viral evolution. 

It is important to note that there is currently not enough data from the early outbreak period to interpret the early history of global transmissions from few genomes in detail. Links that seem directly connected now are likely to be connected via other cases also from other countries not sampled and sometimes can be connected differently later with more data. 

A prime example for this was the first German sample from Bavaria which initially looked like the ancestor of most subsequent European cases only until more sequences came in from China and the Netherlands confirming that the very same variant has been present in multiple locations at the same time which means the transmission routes are much more complex than the early incomplete picture suggested. More data and analysis on ongoing evolution of the virus is becoming available daily via the GISAID platform.",Science/Technology

Adults start thinking, talking and behaving like immature 8 year olds and start calling some bearded guy in Delhi ""daddy"". Even assuming one is COVID-19 positive and has clear malicious intent, why would one need to 'accidentally drop' the currency notes? I mean, handing the currency note over would have exactly the same effect -- dissemination of infection, wouldn't it? 

This man paid the petrol pump attendant using currency notes, after all. Why would the notes that were handed over be clean and those that were dropped be infected?

"I have swallowed the red pill  I share the same story. Born in a typical marwadi family with strong RSS links, I grew up along the same lines, sharing pappu memes, Sonia and MMS conspiracy theories, despising muslims, perceiving modi as our God and what not. I was a real scum growing up but then the recent policy decisions by this govt has pushed us to huge losses, demonetization coupled with GST killed my business which my father had set me up after graduation. My father, grandfather, we all are fed up of this guy all talk and no real groundwork for uplifting the citizens, the CAA NRC didn't help either. When will this government realise that this sort of darr ka mahaul is not that ""business friendly"" and certainly not good for the country as well. I've understood now that agar Mera bhai Abdul khush rahega toh usme meri bhi khushi hai. Of course the occasional ""goli maro salon ko"" will win you elections but uske baad kya? What about the real policy work? Musalmano ki lashon par kab tak sarkar chalaoge. Hum thakk chuke hain! Public ko paisa chahiye, profit chahiye khushi chahiye.. BJP is throwing India towards chronic capitalism. The Income diversity is so fu*king huge in this country that sooner or later we are on the path of Brazil. If we get into that loop hole once which we are going towards smoothly then Ambani and few will rule India for ages and getting out of it is near to impossible. BJP corruption is same like Congress but here they played it smartly. RBI foos, RTI foos, banks foos, telecom companies foos, parliament foos, rajya sabha foos, human rights foos, supreme court foos, BCCI foos, citizenship foos.

\#chaddichandan >The Congress Party was always corrupt as hell, and whether you agree with me or not, it is my opinion that they win votes through a divide and conquer strategy. You separate people into different minority groups, then win their votes one by one.

While I agree congress was always corrupt to the core and never tried to improve upon it, I don't think I agree with the latter part, the divide and conquer strategy. If ever any minority voted for congress is not because congress asked support of minority, it was always because BJP backed up majority, so minorities felt left out and went with congress.

Edit: The BJP also didn't backup majority, they stand for their Hindu nation agenda and Hindus happen to be the majority. Despite corruption, congress never told citizens to live in a certain way. They were guilty of caste and religion politics but it was always means to an end. A thief finding ways to steal. For BJP/RSS, though, it's the end.

A few people here mentioned marwari background. I will urge you to read Gita press. Book is transparently biased but research is sound. I remember the old saying that  politicians, like underwear, should be changed often, and often for the same reasons.

We should probably keep changing our rulers every 5-10 years. But I also feel that along with the government, the opposition, civil society, media and people at large do have their role to play in the larger scheme of things. I personally dont believe in 'saviors' and I think we should judge our leaders objectively on the work they do, irrespective of their ideology or that of our own. 

We should hope that every subsequent government is just a little better than the previous one. That would be an achievement on its own. Bro I've been yelling distilled version of yours and other similar experiences. You and me, no gives a fokk. Political parties, main aim is to stay in power and make money. Someone riles up people about majority politics, the other on minority politics. More people need to wake up and enforce good governance. We have all the power we need but are kept distracted by this huge cacophony of vitriol about religion, region, language etc. 

Look around you, everytime a single misdeed is fortunately unearthed, the offending party gets down to miscolor it with something basic, outright stupid. Their lieutenants herd the populace inyonpro and against stance and we bicker like children, fueled by media baloney.

I am not siding with any so called political sect, but I hope someday, the real intellectuals and educated people come to the forefront and take control of governance as a demoracy is theoretically supposed to run. I appreciate your sharing your thoughts. BJP acts like Congress on steroids. The minorities know they have been sidelined by the national parties. It’s the majority that will decide in which direction the nation must head. There’s only so much hate that can be sown in people’s minds before the nation devolves into chaos. Hey man, I actually feel the same way and agree with most of what you have written. If I had it my way, I would have left this country for good long time ago. Just wondering , where were you born and live now ? All these demo gst etc were with good intention. But they backfired. All these schemes launched but indian didnt change overnight. Rather it setback. Even corona was unexpected. 

But still india is progressing. Its so much bettr now than 10-20 years ago. India of 2000-2010 is closer to rural india type. Now it has become highly modernised  in places where it should be  lik3 big cities etc. Look at punjab there is work but people want white collar job. People can warn enough money to meet daily basic requirements(not basic food but wide variety of exotic food) this was unheard of in small town or rural villages. In villages there is electrification water supply road acces to big cities.  People are getting  educated smarter earning more. They would spend more. This is just the beginning. No matter congress or modi. India should safeguard its progress. We are likr 20% soon we will reach 90%. You havent seen old india. There are layers in indian society. When the bottom layer gets educated enough they would get civic enough to understand their culture. Its just that basic need werent met now as we progress more people will eat better educate  their kids better and then there would be ideal socities. Compare india from past (1990s) to now. Look houlw much internet has made students smarter.  But alas youll only see majority who are enjoying the benfits but wont see the hard working people working on skills or education. These people are going  to be professionals. Dont worry india isnt going to become a hellhole. It always progressing. Its never stopped we dont have civil wars we dont have communal hatred we dont have riots. We may look like backward because we have just started. Remeber india invited foreign companies only in 1995s because they didnt want most population to go jobless. India would rather employ 100 people than automate. But its capitalism is changing these things fast. Visit india from a upper class educated point of view. Youll see that if you forgot about soo many people who are unskilled and getting then youll see india which would be a no better than a eastern european country in terms of richness but very strong culture.

"CBSE school of Kolkata laid off a teacher friend of mine who was serving her notice period making an excuse of saving resources owing to COVID lockdown. What should we do?  Wait..she voluntarily resigned.. and the school decided to cut short her notice period by 14 days. It's not like she was working and got laid off. She was already about to leave in 2 weeks.

The best course of action would be to move on with whatever plans the teacher originally had. This doesn't sound any where closer to devastating. There are people who are actually losing jobs because of corona. If she’s serving her notice period what was she going to do next? I am sorry to sound insensitive but Arushi resigned right and normally she would be serving her notice period. These are uncertain times, so legally since Arushi resigned and her employer accepted her resignation, they can waive the notice period also.

Since Arushi choose to resign, she has no obligation or requirement to stick around to help her colleagues if the employer doesn't want her. Tell Arushi to be more professional as job is a two way relationship. As far as her worries regarding loosing her pay, She should claim her pay till April 15th or the last day her employer made her work, If she is worried about now losing her earnings, then sorry but it was bad timing and unless she requested that her employer rescind her resignation then they are under no obligation.

"Hypocrisy of indian govt. cutting salaries of employees while ordering private sectors to retain all employees on payroll  Kerela government will be cutting salaries of government employees for next five months. All states (and central government) are cutting corners wherever possible. At least salaried people are getting most of their salary with a small cut. Small and medium businesses selling non-essentials have basically zero income these days. There is no guarantee that they may recover in upcoming days and I fear many will have to close their business or go bankrupt. Yes, I was thinking along the same lines. With the kind of business ecosystem this Government has provided for SMEs, they have no right to bring such ridiculous rules. Big corporates can afford to sustain this due to the reserves they possess. Small companies cannot adhere to such practices and why should they? Having said that, I think paying salary during the lockdown is fair because it was just a month and a half. But expecting companies to not lay off someone if there's no business or revenue for an extended period is just idiotic. We are suppliers to automotive companies you can understand our business has turnovers but profitability is not much. It is a labor intensive industry with high overheads. As much as we want to we can’t sustain salary expenses with no revenues. There is no cash flow. Are we supposed to give salaries till we finally go bankrupt. I don’t see banks giving out loans etc easily. The labor union is up our ass. We are so worried. Vote. Them. Out. Remember the day when we banged thalis for police and doctors? Well, those same police officers are getting 30% salary cut to be donated to PM cares. Also, IIRC doctors from AIIMS also had to give up 1 days salary to PM cares.

This article shouldn't be in the Islamophobia list.

Reason: 
I have seen this Live TV, A Relative of mine works at Bhadrachalam Temple Board. 
They had only a mini celebration, they didn't allow pilgrims Only working staff were allowed. Its a ritual that had to be followed and it was done under tight scrutiny. 
Don't just randomly link stuff to Islamophobia. Anyone can write articles, that dosen't necessarily mean its the only truth. Some have false narrative behind.

This happened especially after the Tabligi incident and media was also eager to post Hindu violations. The Print and Quint had this false narrative so please do recheck with local or other news. 

 I understand your well intentions, but his isn't  a good one to make a point. 
Thanks OP. When Kanika Kapoor did her nautanki, people were absolutely ruthless in their abuse directed at her. I remember in early March lots of vitriol being directed towards NRIs for being virus-carriers. There was also a huge amount of abuse towards one lady who allegedly fled from Bengaluru to Agra after learning her husband has corona virus. That news turned out to be fake. But there is no mainstream word like ""NRI-phobia"" or ""Kanika-phobia"". 

The public anger has a lot to do with Islamophobia. But I also think the larger public anger has something to do with these facts you are silent about

a) Foreigners hiding in mosques across India after having attended Tablighi Jamat

b) Stone pelting and attacks on health workers arriving to quarantine/trace contacts of those who attended (yes, 90% of these reports are fake, but these 10% happened. I know of 2 such incidents in my native place Bengaluru itself. Happened in Indore, Surat, Madhubani (Bihar), Moradabad). 

This Tablighi Jamat is already responsible for a large proportion of the cases in Indonesia, Malaysia and Pakistan as well. People are calling even references to Tablighi Jamat as promoting Islamophobia. In the initial days weren't all corona +ve cases identified by ""travel history to Italy"" or ""travel history to China"" etc.  So similarly I see nothing wrong in listing the source as Tablighi Jamat for many cases. Better than ""single source"". 

If I'm not mistaken, a gurudwara function was also responsible as being a super-spreader (you can search and add that to your little list). But this was localised to Punjab. I'm sure if the contacts of those who attended that meet also had returned to places all over the country and pelted stones, spit on and misbehaved with health workers, people wouldn't be saying very nice things about Sikhs either. The people going overboard with the Tablighi Jamat stuff (bio-jihad, etc.) are those who anyway keep demonising Muslims. Why should I, a common citizen, not be annoyed at members of this group for their actions, some which were maybe inadvertent (I don't want to get into the controversy of whether the meets were held before or after Kejriwal's ban on gatherings and all that) but after that has been a very poor behaviour? I don't buy all these excuses that oh they're poor, ill-informed, WhatsApp rumours, don't trust the state blah blah. There's no excuse for violence, especially when it can jeopardize public health. I think this list misses all that and pretends that the reason for the anger is Muslims gathering. It's more than that One standard for me, another for thee

[removed] wow this is super low karma whoring. This is good and helpful. Nice work. It would be good to have a substantial list. It will not change all minds, but it gives some substance for quiet conversations and reflection on our biases.

There are tens of millions, if not hundreds of millions, in groups and communities doing the thing and contributing to find a way out of this crisis. Demonizing entire communities on the basis of the actions of a few is not wrong, inappropriate and not helpful to a resolution. I request the mods to sticky this so that others can contribute as well. Because once the Muslims come on the street to celebrate Eid, the chaddi chors are gonna bhow-bhow again.

The coronavirus lockdown, which is due to end on May 3, will cut road deaths by at least 15% this year compared with 2018, Paresh Kumar Goel, a director at the Ministry of Road Transport & Highways, said. 
With passenger trains halted, fatalities from all-too-common rail accidents have also plunged. In Mumbai alone, for example, more than half a dozen people typically die every day on the rail network.

No country will make it easy to bring in your parents btw. They are not legally considered your dependents. Old people consume more than they produce and governments especially in countries with good universal healthcare systems are quite wary about bringing in older people to become permanent residents. This will only get more and more stringent as the years pass. Even if Australia is very hot, you've lived in India so heat is no issue 😅

As for which country to live in, that depends on you. See what interests you about both places- the climate, culture, friendliness of the people, any language barrier, food, job opportunities for your chosen field, healthcare system, cost of living, accessibility and transport (to move around properly in some places it's necessary to buy a car), etc. Make a list of what all matters to you and decide.

Homeopathic intervention is bullshit :) The lockdown is helping quite a bit to contain the spread. Plus there are pockets which have flattened the curve. Also lower tests. However in terms of the condition of migrant workers and slums, people are of the opinion that we are resting on a ticking bomb. Hope things get better.

For some reason the Indian govt continues to actively fund and look upto the AYUSH ministry which actively lies and makes false claims.

Hope you stay safe. Yea Covid-19 deaths are surprisingly low in India. But I also think for some reason, more people might be dying because of pneumonia, diabetes, etc. Whaddya think? Hope you are safe. To be honest, our coronavirus situation isn't as great as the media is showing it to be. The low number of deaths per million is simply because we are unable to test large sections of the population.

The number of deaths per million will obviously show a skewed ratio. However, comparing the number of deaths to the number of infected individuals, we are surprisingly better off than say the United States, or even Italy.

Also, while a lot of people in India do believe in homoeopathy, it is not being used to treat coronavirus. We are using the same methodologies that all countries are following, that is using a broad spectrum of antibiotics to prevent pneumonia, keep the fever down; and using ICU and ventilators for serious patients.

Everything will fall in the way if you study regularly. Good luck. [deleted] This post is soo sharmaji's son Well, to start off... You have time in your hand.. You are just starting 11th and optimistically speaking you have 2 solid years. So don't be depressed just yet! It's ok to feel so and it means you are genuinely motivated to crack IIT! Secondly ,you also mentioned IAS..I presume you are still contemplating between engineering and IAS? If that's the case, first decide that. I'm no expert in IAS prep but I think it has a lot to do with 6th to 12th syllabus. So I would say concentrate on your 11th syllabus for now. Yes, your school not providing online classes is a problem (and you SHOULD contact them regarding the same), but you can start a bit yourself using the books you have... There are plenty of online sources too(Like byju's)! Make a study plan and take it day by day. And while you should aim for IIT's , you should also know there are plenty of other good colleges too! (Not to be complacent.. but you shouldn't pressurise yourself into thinking IIT is the only way.. It doesn't help) prep with whatever you've got and give it your best! As long as you are motivated and dedicated..You'll do well i'm sure! So don't get depressed or panicked.. just take things one at a time.. also, Talk to seniors who have cracked iit for better advice and if you have genuine friends who feel the same as you, talk to them too and plan together This post is giving me anxiety, even though I have left the IIT phase far behind. Kid, you are just in 11th grade, the earliest you can even give the IAS exam is after 6 years. 6 whole years! Why are you even worrying about something that is so far away? 6 years ago, you were in 5th grade. Are you the same person you were back then? No, right?

In 6 years, you may find out that you have a passion for scientific research or teaching. Hell, you may even find out that you dislike science entirely and pursue something else. Stop worrying about the future and concentrate on the present. Don't forget to enjoy this time as well or else you will only regret later on.

Another thing that really irks me is that people talk about engineering and ias as though they are part of the same career path. Let me clarify something, ias and engineering are completely different! I still remember that when I had finally got admission into a great college after dropping a year, my uncle had said,""Great! You can now prepare for the ias!""

WHY!? Why would I prepare for the ias after going through so much trouble getting into an engineering college? Do you think just getting a degree means you are an engineer?

If you graduate engineering and then stay at home and prepare for ias for two years, your degree would become almost useless by the time you realise that you are not cut out for ias.

Sorry for the rant. This post reminded me about my own experience.

My advise to you would be to work hard but enjoy yourself as well. You will never be a high schooler again. Regret about not getting into an IIT lasts for 8 years but regret about wasting your youth and going into the wrong field lasts for a lifetime. As a student who tried both exams and failed, I think I am better placed to answer this than most. 

**First IIT-** 

Getting into IIT is a matter of hard work. Yes you can be incredibly smart and still get in, but if you work hard, you will surely get in top 1000 rank. 

Getting into IIT is also a insurance policy against the IAS failure (will come back to this point later). If you do manage to get into IIT, rest assured you will earn a decent salary and have a decent life. Ofcourse you will always want more - start the next Flipkart, be the next Raghuram Rajan - but if you step back and compare yourself with the general Indian population, you will feel blessed that you got into IIT. 

Moreover, if you do get into IIT/NIT/BITS you open up a lot of doors. You want to do an MBA - nothing less than IIM. MS- nothing less than a top US college. The possibilities are endless.

**Now, IAS-** 

Getting into IAS is a matter of luck. There are some people who have cleared the exam by brute force of will, hardwork and skill, but these are rare. I have noticed 6 years of candidates and I can name only 2-3 people who truly deserved to clear this exam and who could clear this exam year on year. Most people clear the exam in one year by luck and if they were to write it again, they probably would not. 

I personally know a friend who have given the interview 3 times (he is gave the interview this year but result has been put on hold), cleared the mains 4 times. He is really smart and really hardworking. But his luck runs out at some point or the other - his interview went okay once, his one paper was okay once. So, you cant just bank on the exam. 

The exam is very luck based. Kind of an easier version of getting into the Indian cricket team. For every Kohli who has gotten into the team with hard work, there are even more number of people who couldnt get into India-A team, just because of a bad day, bad weather, bad personal situation etc. *I wouldnt advise you to put all your eggs in the IAS basket.*

**My advise to you**

You should definitely study for IIT now. If you get into any top 50 Engineering college in India, that would be worth it. Even if you fail in UPSC after a couple of attempts, you can give CAT, do an MBA and still have an above average life. This is your insurance which IIT buys. It will buy you peace of mind against the failure of UPSC. 

I know of people who gave UPSC for a couple of year, then went to IIM - A/B/C ( that was 2 years of doing nothing but UPSC btw), went to USA for MS, or just joined a job. IIT helps you with this. 

Also know that only IAS, IPS and IFS are worth the effort. IRS is on par with any job that you might get post IIT, and anything else is plain bad. Either no work, or no power, or too much corruption without the power. So, IIT will help you not take these sub-par options (no offence to anyone who is in those services, but that is just a personal opinion). 

**So, study for IIT now. Forget about IAS. Get into IIT or any other good engineering college. Then you can start to think about IAS.** **IIT** is for engineering.

**IAS** enables you to contribute directly to social upliftment of our country.

**IAS** can be attempted without an IIT degree.

I hope this helps you get some clarity. Just a little confused. Are your 10th exams already over? My sister's have been postponed so even the timing of entrance to 11th is ambiguous.... Studying IIT makes you corporate slave where you will earn enough in exchange for your peace, dignity, self respect and take away other's dignity and lifelines as you climb up the ladder whereas scoring IAS will get you tied to a shoe lace of every corrupt politician for life selling off your soul.

Want a better option than those two while still having all 24 hours for yourself not needing to step outside your house to make an earning or face humiliation while only putting 10% of the total effort you need for IAS, IIT? Learn trading, investment and start trading 6 months from now. By the time you are 30, you will have enough in your coffers to RETIRE for life, ONLY IF you invest smartly and diversify your earnings.

"Why does India have so few coronavirus/Covid-19 cases and deaths?   From the article -

There are **four possible explanations**:

1. The epidemic may have struck later than in other countries. Since epidemics have exponential growth at the start, a small delay can have massive effects on the number of cases.
2. India’s 21-day lockdown may have successfully suppressed the epidemic. Physical distancing is one of the best ways to slow the epidemic and, if anything, many have criticized the lockdown for being too draconian in that regard.
3. India has not been able to test enough to count all cases and deaths. Without sufficient testing, many deaths may not be labeled with Covid-19 for official statistics, leading to an underestimation of the severity of the crisis.
4. India may have protective characteristics against Covid-19. Researchers have proposed that the low share of elderly in the population, the high temperatures and humidity in India, widespread BCG vaccination for tuberculosis, or resistance to malaria have helped India escape the brunt of the pandemic.",Coronavirus

This situation coincides with bigotry comments by Sanghis, which has aggravated the situation. and now they are turning to christians over this palghar thing... they want to make indians unable to work or travel abroad, and be dependent on the mai-baap feudal lords for handouts. They really hated the blue collar workers going abroad and building better lives The virus doesn't see religion, those in power here and their bhakts do.

I think that the time is perfect for a new political party, one that lies even further to the right than the BJP. One that promises a complete rewrite of the constitution and a ""final solution to the muslim problem"".

also know who can't be converted and when to stop most people can't take massive blows to their world view in short period and ignore their bigotry if you can.

you could also do both sideism tactics and make them vote NOTA or soften them up for lesser evilism later

lower middle class focus on economic issues upper middle class rigid people both sideism works well I think there are a few important things we need to do to defeat BJP:

1. Build a cadre. You, better than anyone, know how powerful RSS and BJP are because of the cadre they have. I am myself aware of what CAG/IPAC did in 2014 and chances are we know each other or are one connection apart. Now is the best time to build a cadre when the tensions are running high.
2. West Bengal elections. RSS has been preparing for this forever now. If BJP makes headway in WB then it will be something they will tout for the rest of their term and will go a long way with the rest of their Hindu crowd.
3. Build a network of activists that is on ground and willing to support a united opposition front. These are the people that get the most face time with the public. They will be most helpful.

Lots of great ideas in the comments, but here is the harsh reality on what wont work: spreading a narrative or information online or through liberal news media. They will counter it no matter what it takes its too easy to counter. Can you guys please stop hyping the BJP up?

Just keep your neighbourhood calm and be good. Those brain dead morons are doing a better job of destroying themselves than we can ever hope to. /u/Bhaktslayer007, do you think, if powers that be in the opposition, construct their party machinery ( read: propaganda machinery) would be efficient against the BJP or let it be fought locally, state wise with powers like AAP emerging out of the rubble?

Also, don't you think this isn't merely a party fighting to win elections anymore but to set an ideological soul for our country? I still refuse to believe that bjp can stay in power simply by Hindu muslim, this whole discourse is for the middle class, upper middle class and elites and TV debates, qhich is why all of us are so distressed by it all, but a common villager is still unaffected and largely insulated, a vast majority of this country is poor and deaperate and they still vote on immediate results and tangible developments, the moment they see a credible face from the opposition this whole chanakya neeti will fail. So opposition needs to find a credible face, rahul Gandhi's image is beyond repair it has to be someone else, my choice would be either amrinder Singh or bhupesh baghel. Tell us, is EVM manipulation really talked about among the workers?


As for your question, maybe they'll win 2024 as well.

We cannot stop them given there is no other party to challenge them. All institutions are compromised so they can do whatever they want.




But many will vote for Congress in 2024 given the state of what's happening in India.




Other parties NEED to step up.


Lowering their complete domination in the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha would be a small victory.





If you were aware of their plan, why the fuck would you work with them? We need a strong opposition party, opposition is the second most powerful piller in democracy .Media, the strongest of all is already broken. It's opposition's job to keep check on ruling party, question there every move, but it's been almost 3 months and today Soniya Gandhi made a statement. They should be one leading these protests.
I still can't understand how BJP won with such magin in 2019. I mean it was obvious that they'll win again but with that many seat. Who are those ppl who voted for BJP again. There were so many failures in PM Modi's first tenure, Demonetization, Rafale, communal hate, institutional degradation. I wonder if majority of my fellow countrymen is really dumb.

Stand on CAA-NRC-NPR Decided After Consulting NCP and Congress: Uddhav Thackeray  So... Congress is just BJP minus cows?,Politics
"The problem with current CAA protests - from a right wingers perspective  \#1 Solid proposal

There is already a solid proposal with centuries of theory and practice. It's called **investigations.** *<OMG frantic screaming. Such blasphemy!>* You know, like in any other crime. Do you go stand in queue and give alibi each time there's a murder in your area to prove you are **not** the murderer? The burden of proving a person is illegal immigrant should shift to the government. And indeed that was exactly how it was until BJP I drafted rules to shift it onto the person.

&#x200B;

\#2 Existing refugee system

Actually, we don't have a refugee law. Any person deemed illegal immigrant cannot get citizenship by naturalization - that's the wording of the Citizenship Act '55.

What we have is an SOP followed by MHA. An immigrant can claim they are a refugee fleeing persecution by showing proof. Then government carries out a case-by-case evaluation and either grants few of them a LTV (long term visa) or rejects. Those who get LTV are no longer labelled ""illegal immigrants"" and therefore become eligible for naturalization.

**If this system is good enough for you, then why do you require a CAA at all?**

Also, CAA protests are not about foreign muslim refugees. The protests are mainly about its planned use as a pincer movement to aid disenfranchisement of *Indian muslim citizens* through NRC. Have you Shah's chronology samajhlijiye?

In addition, they are also about the arbitrary exclusion based on religions, arbitrary date (which means even hindu refugees get denied) and arbitrariness of location (which means pre-2014 refugees who settled in NE get denied).

This is a good ELI5 video on the motivations behind these protests - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4ZSpqpfvQs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4ZSpqpfvQs)

This is a good article on why idea of NRC itself is immoral - [https://thewire.in/rights/nrc-caa-assam-accord](https://thewire.in/rights/nrc-caa-assam-accord). The problem isn't with the nature of anti-CAA protestors or their tactics but the whole intention of the act. IF, it's a big IF, the govt genuinely cared about the sikhs and dalit hindus of pakistan and afghanistan who have come here before 2014 and wanted to give them citizenship, they could have done it in a minute in the existing form form of the CAA. All they had to do is expedite the process and voila, they all get citizenship. No harm no foul. There was zero need to link religion with citizenship or make them prove they were persecuted on the basis of their religion ( you ever sit down and think how those poor souls are going to prove that to a govt babu?). 

I say bring back ALL the hindus and sikhs from afghanistan, pakistan and bangladesh in first class flights and bring them here, like how the Israelis do, just don't fuck around with the muslims for shits and giggles while you are at it, no? Since you are a right-winger I am sure you will agree with me here. Firstly few points need to be cleared very well to everyone.

1. This CAA does nothing, I mean absolutely nothing for any minorities living in Pak, Afg, Ban right now, it's for those who are already here in India, so all this advertisement about how we are saving minorities in these countries is fake.

2. CAA is not exactly about giving exclusive citizenship, it's about fast tracking the process of getting citizenship for these people, they would have eventually gotten citizenship even without CAA but it would have taken longer, just like the muslim immigrants/refugees would also be able to get.

3. The opposition parties of our country are absolutely useless, they will walk out of the parliament and cry in front of the media, why the fuck are you even elected as MPs if you can't stay inside the parliament and oppose something you see is wrong, fuck with your cowardice way of protesting and giving up, losers.

4. Personally I hate absolutely everything where religion gets involved, I am not an atheist and that's why I don't like my religion getting dragged in these shits.
I am not a fan of using religion in any debate, argument, decision making and law making process.

5. I am a supporter of the idea of CAA, i.e. giving citizenship to the refugees and immigrants who deserves, I mean who are living here for long enough and can't have anywhere to go back to, I support the idea of giving them citizenship and let them and their childrens live a meaningful life where they will get the basic rights like education, healthcare etc.

6. I think our country has enough resources and more than enough brilliant minds from different fields so that we can find a solution of every problem without involving religion in any situation, but I guess they just don't want to do it, which is really sad and as I mentioned above the opposition of this country is absolutely garbage level useless bunch of shits. If you trust the government then give us your details and we will report you as a doubtful citizen, mind you no action will be taken against us even if the complaint is proven false.

Citizenship is not extended to Tamil Hindus, so you clearly haven't understood CAA

India doesn't have any laws in place to naturalise persecuted minorities, that's  the reason why Tamil Hindus are still live in camps even after 40 years of srilankan Tamil genocide.

All this proves that right wingers either don't know about our citizenship laws, or they choose to support it because it teaches Muslims a lesson. The stand of Gauhati High Court that , the burden to prove citizenship on the person is wrong.

It is like saying , you aren't citizen of india , and we don't know which country you belong to either.

NRC in Assam also failed. This is like saying if you oppose Demonetization you are supporting corruption. There are much much better ways to remove corruption than Demonetization. And you know what? Demonetization didn't achieve its intended objectives. 

Likewise, there are better ways to keep infiltrators at bay. If anyone thinks CAA+NRC is a foolproof solution for the infiltrators problem, I would say that person is a complete idiot just like anyone who still supports DeMo. 

The CAA should be rejected outright because it's unconstitutional. Mixing citizenship with religion is the worst thing to have ever happened to our nation. The NRC should be rejected because it's anti-poor. Just like how rich got their blackmoney converted during DeMo, they would not face much problem with NRC process. For the poor, this wreak havoc in their lives. 

Like with DeMo, NRC is like burning the whole mill to find the insects. It's stupid. The govt should be burdened with identifying who is an immigrant/corrupt. The burden should not be on the citizen. 

I know you would still not agree to this. But just understand, we wont show the papers not because of the reasons you think it is nor because we don't think there could be illegal immigrants. If you fail to understand this basic thing, you are the biggest idiot. And I am not here to correct you. I have one problem, why don’t government prove that I am illegally residing in India by providing nationality proof from other country. Because any document which I hold now, is just a piece of trash.
Unless they don’t have document to prove this, otherwise I should claim stake of my citizenship.
All of us here are very well off compared to half of the Indian population who doesn’t understand law and will be and is grinder by this law. > fundamental premise that India needs to meet these objectives,

> a. Secure borders and eliminate any illegal immigration 

> b. Deport any illegal immigrants 

The current BJP policy of  totally violates your fundamental premise.

Here is the situation, in Assam's NRC process, it detected lakhs of illegal Hindus & Muslim illegals. BJP shouted then & rejected these NRC results and then said no Hindu (illegals) will be deported.

Thereby violating your ""deport any illegals"" premise a.

Next BJP shamelessly introduces CAA to give these illegals citizenship via backdoor. Thus is the reason Assam was/is protesting.

B premise is not covered by CAA or NRC, CAA is about retrospective citizenship. And NRC is about documenting existing people already inside the country. It does not 'secure' the borders at the point of entry.

You have taken a rather simplistic approach to these issues. People are protesting for multiple reasons and your premise itself is flawed that protesting = open borders. I think the idea of secularism in India itself is biased. The whole NRC-CAA debate comes down to that. Whenever even a bit of liberty has been given to the right wing, we become non tolerant or non secular. 
CAA states that citizenship be given to people who were persecuted i their country due to religious beliefs, I dont think muslims are persecuted in bangladesh or pakistan? Forget that, the whole Shaheen bagh incident? Why doesnt anyone talks about who is sponsoring the sit in? And if I disagree with anyone I have the right to jam the road as well? Will I be treated as the same? I agree with the govt on one thing, just because a few people protest and they take back a law, no laws can be passed in a country.

How the fuck is abrogation of article 370 devisive or destructive?? Good always wins over evil. But in order for good to win, good has to be in the fight. Have you ever considered the similarities between Nazi Germany in the 1930's and India today under Modi? There is the same demonisation of minorities, detention of it's own citizens, imposition of ideology, grandiose vanity projects (think Ram Mandir and Albert Speer), and all against a backdrop of a plunging economy and soaring unemployment. Dissent is squashed, free speech and opinion is censored,  legitimate protest is labelled anti-nationalist, and protesters are called traitors. Consider also the open sore that is Kashmir, and parallels with the Treaty of Versailles...
This is not the India we grew up in. This is not the India of  Ashoka, of the Buddha, of Tagore or Ambedkar or Gandhi. Modi has unleashed the genie of communalism - and it will not be contained.

Stick to your constitutional right to protest, If you are someone with brains then find a way to dismantle their strategies in any way possible, If you are a good speaker then speak, If you can draw then let your art reflect the dissent... As you want to write then write about it and do a lot of research about it. Sab pele jayenge, I repeat sab pele jayenge Not in even our grandchildren's life time . Sure there is a way to stop this. Next elections, instead of going for long drives or vacations on election days, if everybody votes responsibly we might stop this. Vote on the basis of work done, not caste, community, Creed or face. Vote at local level. Each vote matters. Delhi, MP, Chattisgarh have proved that voting matters. This might be an unpopular opinion but conduct a free, fair referendum in Kashmir, mediated by the UN, with a large number of internal, external observers including Separatist leaders, citizen representatives and extensive media coverage.

We LGBT folks have enough issues to protest for, we don't want to give more fuel to the haters, this way even the folks who are moderate/indifferent on LGBT issues will turn against. (Nothing brings bigots from hindu-muslim groups together than LGBT hate. Exhibit: the other(tm) India sub, and Most of the Islamic preachers)

And yes we want all equal rights for everyone not just LGBT folks, but baby steps please! Let everyone protest for their own issues rather than mixing it up.

Non-sequitur: one of the reasons I moved out 2 years ago. Then they decriminalized it and I thought okay maybe things are slowly getting better, then the trans bill happened, and I'm not even going to talk about my views on the whole CAA NRC shitshow going on. The community didn't speak out, only one person held a sign. How about we hold ourselves to higher standards in using proper headlines and avoid spreading rumors. Also for those wondering why the queer community have been heavily involved in the protests - there are queer Muslims, Dalits and North East folk too! They're much worse affected by these laws than the rest of their community. So, the entire queer community (excluding a few who chose to remain apolitical) protests against these laws that will target their own the worst What does being bisexual have to do with this?  It wasn't needed. It was a LGBTQ parade, not an anti CAA really. 1 playcard does not mean everyone in the rally supported anti CAA sentiments",Politics
"A poem that I wrote in light of the ongoing protests against CAA/NRC/NPR (Translation in comments)  This poem is a question for people who support the ongoing violence to suppress the voices of dissent. Here is the translation:

**Will you too show the paper?**


When the wisdom of the kings is shabby,

then the police are equally barbaric.

Today Ayashi is soaked with blood,

Will you get your children beaten tomorrow?


**Will you too show the paper?**
  
  
When Shaheen's nights tremble,

The grannies chant ""Inquilab"".

That cold chill in those old fingers,

Will you let your mother feel that tomorrow?

**Will you too show the paper?**
  
  
When they go to my ancestral home,

Men-in-uniforms sabotage everything

Today my streets have become ashes,

Will you let your city burn tomorrow?

**Will you too show the paper?**
  
  
Sagir-Bilal died of body,

Gopal-Kapil died of mind.

If there is still silence in your eyes,

Will you look into your kid's eyes tomorrow?

**Will you too show the paper?**
  
  
We all are his children, he says

then why is there bloodshed in his name?

In this twisted business of religion,

Will you let your descendants die?

**Will you too show the paper?** I'm not educated in gauging a poetry, but I can understand the sentiments and I firmly apreciate them. Nicely written bro!

"Can some people here share uplifting stories about how majority of their families and friends are seeing through Modi-Shah and are anti CAA, NRC & NPR?  Yep! My dad was a hard core BJP supporter. Defended demonitozation, GST implementation, beef ban and Ajay Bhisht. Blind allegiance. It's been years of talking and fighting but he is finally coming around. Last week he openly praised Kanhaiya Kumar after I showed him the 2018 Kerela Lit fest video and also confessed that he didn't like this Hindu Muslim narrative that BJP and it's goons are peddling. I won't say he is anti BJP but he is opening up to the idea that the non Congress opposition isn't as bad as the media made them out to be.

Also he was really scared when I joined the local anti CAA protest and was very vocal about it on social media. It forced him to think. My mother has been Anti BJP since 2014, when modi wave was at its full swing. Whenever asked by anyone why she is so Anti BJP my mum asks one question, show me an educated and qualified politician in BJP. My father is a typical swing voter, give me good service I'll vote for you.

Edit: a word My parents are tired of the govt not functioning I saw that my best friends winced when article 370 was abrogated. After that they grew suspicious and now after being hardcore modi fans they are completely against his ideas.
I have seen my classmates who were hardcore right-wing join anti CAA protest.
So all is not lost I believe the first step is to stop calling them brainwashed, even if you feel they are. There's no winning people if you demonise and look down upon them at the outset. A lot of what people think is malicious can be easily chalked upto ignorance.

The best way to make people realise any point is to make them empathise with the situation. If you can successfully do that, you've done your job. Post that, it's up to them, what they do with the new found information.

For example, we were having a discussion about Kashmir at home and lot of people at my home were of the opinion that whatever is happening is correct - simply because they were unaware of the entire reality. Everybody has their own version of truth, which they believe is right (and it often is, just that it is not exhaustive.) They told me how the locals harass the army people, kidnap and even murder them. I listened and told them yes, these things do happen and it's unfortunate that soldiers who are just doing their duty are being abused in this manner.

Then, I told them the story of how I met a Kashmiri student, and how he had told me he saw his own friend get killed in front of his eyes for simply falling in love with an Army man's daughter, and faced no consequences. I then asked them, if it was me or my friend who got killed that way, wouldn't you absolutely hate the police? In another incident, army men went inside a local boy's home and manhandled the females of the house, which was personally told to me by a friend who had been to Kashmir. I said, if somebody did that to my Mom or sister, I'd obviously hate the army too.

That's when they realised that any story has multiple perspectives and the situation isn't as black and white as they thought it to be and generalising an entire population without knowing the context serves no purpose.

So yes, talk to them, put across your point politely and at the same time, try to understand what they believe in and why they do so. Simply throwing facts or calling them names won't change people's minds - it in facts deepens their conviction in what they believe.

A divided India is foolish India and that's what they want. Even the next election BJP will win. Why? Because they are fueling the same propaganda which our well-read uncles & aunts like to speak about and they vote for. BJP's vote bank is this crowd and not the Yuva crowd.

"Have a few questions regarding CAA  1. We will know the final number only after nationwide NRC, if that happens. Hopefully it doesn't

2. The rules and proof required for applicability of CAA is yet to be framed. Though Amit Shah had said in an interview that once CAA is passed no proof would be required as long as you belong to any of those 6 religions, there is an official govt clarification from PIB that's saying that rules and proof required would be soon defined and only those applicable would be given citizenship.

3. The classification is arbitrary in my opinion and as per many constitutional experts. The SC has asked govt to prepare its argument and the case is going to come up next on 22nd Jan. The burden is on the govt to prove why their classification is not arbitrary. But if they have a SC bench favorable to them, they might have an easy way out of it.

4. Yes the NRC and CAA go hand-in-hand and no less than Amit Shah has said this multiple times. The rules for Assam NRC are known while the rules for nationwide NRC is still unkown. The doubtful citizens rules is at this time at the discretion of the district authorities which is even worse than any rule that the govt can ever devise. The district authorities can mark anyone ""doubtful"" arbitrarily or maliciously or even politically.

5. Yes. BJP atleast initially planned CAA as a default safety net. But with now extensive protests, they seem to be taken aback. As a face saving measure, I think they are now thinking of defining rules for CAA. But the fact of the matter is, nobody can ""prove"" that they were religiously persecuted. So I am waiting to see what kind of comedy they do in trying to frame these rules and define the process. All those excluded from NRC list and without the benefit of CAA would be sent to detention centers after being stripped of their citizenship.

6. The total illegal immigrants identified through the Assam NRC process is around 19 Lakh far less than the 2 Crore number that was expected. And the various sources indicate that the majority of them are Hindus. I believe around 12-15 Lakh would be Hindus and they have the CAA safety net. Rest 4-7 Lakh Muslims will be sent to detention centers. This is exactly one of the points of the protests. All these questions have been hanging around for a long time, and the government as such hasn’t clarified anything regarding these. This has led to a loss of trust in the government by the people, and is only giving more weight to the arguments accusing the government of having ulterior motives. 

As for the 3rd question though, the reason of ‘religious persecution’ was provided in support of the bill, and not as a qualifier for getting citizenship. The bill does not mention the word ‘persecution’ anywhere in the text, and so there would be no necessity to prove that a person was persecuted on any ground as such. Everyone who belongs to the religions mentioned in the bill and satisfies the 2014 criterion would be provided citizenship, regardless of the reason they came to India.",Politics

Stop participating in and giving money and support to religious orgs, temples, priests, non-secular institutions and chauvinistic groups. Protests must last all the way upto 2024.

"Good time to start large scale protests FOR economic reforms?  This is not so straight forward. We need a knowledgeable and seasoned economist to steer us out of the present situation. It’s not easy for the layman to protest something like economic reforms, as we don’t have enough knowledge of the subject. Let’s stay focused on CAA. This movement is very much about economic improvement of the country!

What is needed MOST for economic opportunity is the absence of fear. We need independence from fear.

And that's where the word Azadi becomes important.

And the way to gain that freedom, is to get the government to work for us, not us to work for them.

It is the governments duty to give us the protection from crime, corruption, threats to life, so that we can be free to pursue economic activity.

Instead what we have now is a system that threatens every single move we make because others are ALLOWED by us to use their powers against us!

And we have a government who instead of fixing that system, has been using it to take away our last freedoms while giving away our country's wealth to a handful of people.

Who else but we will step in and say enough is enough?

And we don't need violence. Because we have truth and right on our side. All we need is debate.

Talk to us, with facts and reason. And we can end this right now.

People will stop us from having a debate by creating violence.

But why let them stop us? Why not police and judicial reforms. On a different note, i have a concern and may be i am wrong, but it think that if the economy starts to grow and shows sign of improvement due to stimulus and changes made by the government, the support given to the CAA protest by some especially due to bad macro-economic conditions would go away.. what do you think ? Seems like a motherhood statement. What particular reforms? 

If the answer was so clear cut, it would have happened already. As the old saying goes, never let a crisis go to waste' Think for a moment that you are a business man. You invest money to make profit. If you are not sure that you can make profit, you would hold your money until times are better. When will better time come? 
When consumers are confident enough to spend. 
When you do not have to fear that tax babus would come knocking on your door every week asking to show the records and treat you like a criminal.

If Mamata doesn't appease BJP, the Chit Fund scam investigation will knock out her closest aides, and maybe even herself. And that's why you see her playing both sides. She has to remain in power in Bengal while not pissing off BJP too much.

"The problem with the anti-CAA protests is the messaging adopted by the liberals and the leftists  I am with kejriwal on this one. NRC will disproportionately affect poor people. Our local bureaucracy will have a price for the required documents, and people with money will obtain it, regardless of relegion. This is what happened in Assam as well. The government has declared war on the poor and the working class of this country, and there is a good chance that both sides has not realised this yet. It's simple isssue 
The thing is there are systematically trying to make an electorate, that is suited to their political ambitions

They're trying to disenfranchise a lot of people, tribals poor and people who they think doesn't belong to India

It's a question of many things
Governmental inefficiency , corruption and misuse of power as any government officials can declare you stateless and say to furnish proof of your citizenship
It' would led to creating a system of continuous harassment for certain sections of the society Modi did not think twice screwing up the economy with demonetization for BJP own gains. . Demonitization was done solely so BJP would be the only party to have money to win UP elections. CAB /NRC is to mainly to get Bengal. And they will most likely succeed. They are focussed on their own goals. They don’t care if something is good for the populace or not. In their mind its good for the long term goal of Hindu rashtra that will secure the future and safety of Hindus with a Hindu homeland. They're so many flaws with the CAA and NRC itself. Although upfront a protest seems to be because of one reason. They're well aware of the drawbacks. That's the reason not just Muslims but Hindus too are protesting for the bill.
Also NRC here is suspected to be applied on everyone else except the Muslims. That's its sole purpose according to Mo-Shah's agenda. This whole process puts a lot of authority on local officials like say the district magistrate or some other political appointee even. Such a person can countersign and verify someone's claim that they have lived in the locality and that then becomes valid in the eye of the law. This being India the process needs to be smoothened with bribes as well. Or if the person in authority has orders from above that person can easily discriminate between religions with total impunity. People affected by them might not have the means to resort to legal procedures to right this wrong. The bhakts hope to be on the right side of the process as they very well might be in such a case.

In Assam families had to pay lakhs of money to get their names in the NRC list even if there was like a very small and quite common discrepancy like difference in spelling of names in two different document.

Also this sort of legislature might provide a precedent for such discriminatory laws in future too. Then it might reduce the non bjp vote base and help bjp that way too. The innumerable ramifications of this law is just sooo fucked up it sort of is mind-blowing in a way. > So India born Hindus and other minorities like Sikhs or Parsis or Siddis can also get fucked, right?

No. Amit Shah said no documents would be required as proof It affects poor Hindus who are too poor to protest or to understand the consequences. You are partially right but also wrong. The intent of NRC, however malicious it is, is to identify illegal immigrants and not make anyone without a document an illegal immigrant. Let's take few scenarios to understand better.

A Sikh/Jain anywhere in India who is not able to prove that he is a legal citizen of India is automatically assumed that he is from India/Pakistan(Erstwhile British Raj) and hence given citizenship through CAA.

All non-Tamil Hindus anywhere in India who is not able to prove that he is a legal citizen of India is automatically assumed that he is from India/Pak/Bangladesh (Erstwhile British Raj) and hence given citizenship through CAA. For instance, a Bengali Hindu can either be from India or Bangladesh. Similarly, a Hindu is Punjab/Kashmir can either be from India or Pakistan. A  Marathi/Kanadiga Hindu even if they are not able to prove, they could not have come from anywhere else. 

A  Buddhist/Christian who is not able to prove that he is a legal citizen of India will have to claim that he is from PAk/Afg/BD. Depending on mother tongue and facial features, the govt would know whether what he claims is true or if he could be from Tibet/Bhutan/SL. So they will give citizenship through CAA on case to case basis.

A Tamil (whether he is Hindu/Muslim/Christian) who is not able to prove that he is a legal citizen of India **could** be sent to detention center on a case to case basis as the govt could argue that he could be a SL Tamil or descendant of SL Tamil.

A Muslim who is not able to prove that he is a legal citizen of India **would** be sent to detention center on a case to case basis as the govt could argue that he could be from Pakistan/BD. There is a greater possibility of him being sent to detention center if he is in WB/NE/Kashmir. >Then these Muslims would have to wait for 11 years to be able to apply for citizenship in India, in the meantime losing their assets and their right to work or free movement within India

SO THEIR FUTURE GENERATIONS WONT BE CITIZENS TOO. Yes, another fact that's not mentioned enough is that the CAA in inself is bad for all Indians as the Assamese have realised. CAA is essentially citizenship in exchange for votes. And is against our national interest, assuming that we don't want to encourage more low skilled migration into India. Its also a security hole, as has been pointed out in the IB report itself.

The fact that Bhakts are burning the country and compromising national security so that immigrants get a better life is something that should be highlighted more, as that's something that's totally against right wing policies.

"Why can't we protest for relections? They broke the constitution, whats stoping us from demanding relections? [R]  The constitutional way of re-election is mobilizing the house towards no confidence motion leaving no option but to dissolve the house for president. 

How can you do that if the ruling party has absolute majority and MPs are not voting against confidence vote? LoL they would win with a Even bigger majority The house needs to be dissolved. >People should just protest for all the NRC NPR CAA Data trans bullshit fuck my country's economy in the ass bullshit bills money into relections for the rajya sabha and just kill this nonsense

"Chronology of Exclusion - CAA NPR NRC  > UK, USA, Germany have all rejected this process in their countries ...

This ridiculous statement just undermines the whole chart. What exactly (this process) are you comparing to/source ?Just name dropping of western countries does not make the chart more believable. If a hindu, Christan, Sikh gets left out of NRC he still has to prove that he belongs to either Pakistan, Bangladesh or Afghanistan to get citizenship through the citizenship amendment act, 2019. How do you think he'll do that ? How come tribals and other minorities are getting deported? Any sources? And who do you think you are trying to create your own flow chart on how things will proceed in future.
Don't anticipate Non Citizen Muslims and other 'Muslim minority' belonging to Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Bangladesh will be detained. The chart has serious problems. pura desh demo ke tarah line me laga rahega aur chutiya banta rahega.

"Not so frequently asked questions about NPR (yet)  Nice answer, I read all of it.
I have a question. If a person is an NRI and if NRC is implemented do they too have to prove their citizenship by flying over to India? if it is the MODI will lose a huge bhakt base of its NRI citizens that too vote now. CONmen say this...not Modi-Govt 😜😜😜😜😜😜

In this post, at least the following sections should be highligted

>This is very important to understand because the Government can make changes to these rules anytime they want. Rules are basically subordinate laws that the central government can issue through a gazette notification at any time. These laws do not require the approval of the parliament.

--
>But because the Government can make the rules under the Passport Act essentially at whim, the government can simply strike out the second condition and keep only the first. Thanks for taking time to write this one dude.... Really helpful >The tricky part is proving religious persecution in another country.

>To benefit from the CAA, the person issued a specified proforma by the NPR must prove that, one, they are a non-Muslim migrant from Afghanistan, Pakistan or Bangladesh, and, two, that they came to India to escape religious persecution.

>*(read with the point mentioned in CAA) But because the Government can make the rules under the Passport Act essentially at whim, the government can simply strike out the second condition and keep only the first.

"The protests are not against the inclusion of prosecuted minorities from Pakistan, Bangladesh, Afghanistan or to make CAA pro-Muslim  I am sorry but i  dont even buy this bullshit of persecuted minority argument. The day amit tadipar stated pakistan had 23% hindu now they have 2%, was the day i threw this argument out. Even BBC and newyork time calling him out. He fucking lied and no one dares to correct him in india, this whole law is based on big lie and smartly crafted stat.

"Citizenship Amendment Act(CAB/CAA), National Registry of Indian Citizens(NRC/NRIC) - the past, present and a possible future  Thank you for making this post. It is true that NRC has been proposed since a very long time, but what i am worried about is the implementation. Does the state have the resources and time to pull this off effectively and efficiently? Will the first draft of the NRC list be made with census and Aadhar data, or it would be like Assam, i.e. nrc centres will be set up and everyone would have to get their documents verified?",Policy/Economy
"CAB Bill 2019 - News/Protests/Editorials Megathread  Please maintain decency and respect while dealing with adverse opinions. Report comments or posts you feel which goes against our rules or should not be present in discourse here. 

[**r/india Submission Rules and Guidelines**](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/wiki/rules?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf#wiki_general_guidelines) As a person from Assam, let me clear something out for you guys:

The Assamese are protesting the CAB because there are too many illegal immigrants in Assam, and they want none of them irrespective of their religion.

The left is protesting the CAB because muslims are not included in it and they want all of them to be accepted by India.

Neither congress nor BJP are actually thinking about what Assamese people want. This is the stupidest law I have ever seen or heard.How are they going to prove anyone’s religion?  What if some one comes in and becomes a Muslim? Will they lose their citizenship? 
What about persecuted athiests in every Muslim country? And why bother doing this when you are already an overpopulated country with lot of poverty and can’t care for their own population? I'm in Delhi to pick up my sister, and she's refusing to go home because there's still plenty to be done here. So I've decided to stay back and help her however I can.

Thankfully, she confirms that **no student has died** as I had previously said. The students who were assumed to have died were shot and disappeared in the chaos. They've all been found and sent to hospitals. To the redditor who pointed this out to me, I hope you forgive me for my anger. 

We're going to keep organising shelter and aid for students for the foreseeable future. For now, I have a long call with my boss and my parents to get through. Just came from a protest at Mumbai University. Atleast the Modi-Shah duo has completely lost the youth of the country. Hoping something similar from the previous generation in near future. Live from Hyderabad: Got picked up by the cops at Gandhi Bhavan metro station and bused to Moinabad Police Station. We aren't allowed to leave till 5 PM, which is after the protest at Necklace Road will end.

We've been in touch with lawyers. I hope Modi is unable to provide documents for NRC and Amit Shah uses that to usurp power and become the supreme leader. for genuine news updates follow  https://twitter.com/PTI_News

'I swear on every Biryani I've had since childhood, we are with you.' It's been a week since peasant Leader and RTI activist Akhil Gogoi has been arrested - randomly picked up while he was peacefully protesting against CAB in Jorhat district in Assam. This was before the bill was passed in the Parliament and before the fire of democratic assertion spread to the entire country. They have booked Gogoi under the horrific UAPA and handed him over to NIA and taken him to Delhi. Cameras caught him being transferred in an inhumane manner, with his hands tied behind his back when he shouted out to the reporters that he is being tortured. Today his mother has started a hunger strike demanding his release. The national media needs to show this to the people of the country. There is an undeclared national emergency in the country right now. Ritesh Deshmukh tweeted in support of the students. At least some people in the movie industry have a spine.",CAA-NRC
